            " but I quickly got used to it , ",
            " and now I love them !",
            "Bought these on one of the lighting deals during the holiday season .\nI liked ",
            " according to my mom ",
            " who walks between 5-10 miles a day during the winter season .\nShe said ",
            " and told me ",
            "These are so warm , and so amazing .\nI ordered them a 1/2 size bigger as per the reviews ",
            " -LRB- normally a 6 -RRB- , ",
            " I have always had issues ",
            " getting blisters around my ankles from snowboots , ",
            " and have not experienced anything like that with these .",
            "I live in Boulder , CO ",
            " and we 've gotten plenty of snow this winter , ",
            " I 've worn these boots almost every day ",
            " and they fit perfectly .\nHighly recommend !",
            "I usually wear ",
            " to put them on .",
            "I did n't get these from Amazon ",
            " and they have got to be the prettiest snow boot ",
            " that I have ever seen .\nThey are tall and bold .\nAs bold in style ",
            " as they appear , ",
            " they are equally sedate .\nBy that I mean ",
            " that they look very much like a boot for the snow and cold , ",
            " yet the parts of the boot ",
            " specifically chosen to keep out the snow and the cold are made ",
            " when you look at the style of the boot itself .\nIt makes for quite a fashion statement .\nPeople are going to look at you ",
            " or `` Wow , I just love your boots '' .\nThe picture does not do them justice .\nI purchased the Black/Gray color ",
            " and they match everything .\nThey are made ",
            " to be totally in style now ",
            " and yet , will withstand any trend ",
            " because they are , after all , ",
            " snow boots .\nThe leather trim on them are quality ",
            " made exceptionally well ",
            " and is pleasing to the eye as well .\nThe sole of the boot is made solid ",
            " and looks to be made ",
            " to last a lifetime .\nThe tongue of the boot runs all of the way up the boot ",
            " and it is made ",
            " and they have the nerve ",
            " to be extremely comfortable .\nThey are light ",
            " and bend very easily with your gait .\nI have a bad back ",
            " so the weight a boot has , ",
            " coupled with plowing through a bank of snow ",
            " that they provide ",
            " is exceptional .\nNothing , not snow , rain , or cold is getting in these boots .\nI think ",
            " that I have ever owned ",
            " but ",
            " since they are designed ",
            " so that you can just tighten or loosen them ",
            " using the string system ",
            " built into the boot .\nI will say ",
            " that the boot fits snug in the sense ",
            " that the fur inside really envelops you .\nIt 's supposed to though .\nThey wo n't feel tight ",
            " but your legs will feel ",
            " as snug as a bug in a rug ",
            " yet you will easily able to wear jeans inside these boots .\nBe sure to take your time ",
            " where the top of the foot meets the bottom of your leg ",
            " that you can use to slip your finger through , ",
            " then grab and hold , thus ",
            " allowing you to hold onto it ",
            " as you slide your foot into the boot .\nI did this ",
            " after I initially adjusted the strings to my liking .\nYou will find yourself using this hook a lot .\nI must admit ",
            " that I would have preferred ",
            " the strings just make it .\nMy point is , ",
            " you might want to leave the boot open ",
            " that much more , hence , ",
            " that I am extremely satisfied with the purchase of these boots ",
            " and would highly recommend them .",
            "I purchased this item as a gift ",
            " and the receiver of the boots loved the item .\nIt was actually a gift ",
            " that was picked out from the begining and due to the colors ",
            " the item was chosen .\nI have not seen or heard the feedback , ",
            " but She did n't want to return the item , ",
            " so this should speak for it self ...",
            "I have ",
            " been searching for a pair of boots for quite some time .\nAfter purchasing four pairs ",
            " these were the winner .\nI was a little nervous ",
            " about getting them on , ",
            " as other reviews mentioned ",
            " that all of the laces were difficult to lace up ",
            " and time consuming .\nThankfully , I was able to slip them on right out of the box , ",
            " and were extremely warm .\nThey are Well made boots and very fashionable .\nI wear leggings often with dresses and sweaters ",
            " and I think ",
            " and I plan on making them a staple in my winter attire .\nDo n't hesitate , ",
            " you wo n't be disappointed with these boots !",
            "My wife loves these - ",
            " but no more !\nThey are huge though , ",
            " so are hard to travel with ",
            " -LRB- unless you wear them on the plane ;--RRB- ...",
            "I bought my first pair of these boots in Germany ",
            " the first pair wears out , ",
            " but I do n't see that happening any time soon .\nI have worn my first pair almost every day for two winters ",
            " and they keep my whole body warmer , ",
            "Loved the style of these boots .\nSo far no snow yet but they look ",
            " like they will take the snow well .\nI think ",
            " they will keep me warm and dry .\nIf I find out differently ",
            " will update my review .",
            " and feel great on .\nThey are very comfortable and pretty lightweight .\nI have n't worn them outside yet , ",
            " but I 'm sure ",
            " I will soon .\nI am very short , ",
            " but are still easy to get on ",
            " and are comfortable to walk around in .\nI was a bit scared ",
            " to spend that kind of money on snow boots , ",
            " but I think ",
            " they are going to be totally worth ",
            " it when it starts to snow in a few weeks .",
            "I 've already got quite a few pairs of Timberlands ",
            " where we are now ",
            " and I just treck through it .\nThese boots dont absorb the moisture from the snow , ",
            " and are very well insulated ",
            " so that ",
            " if you were to just stand in the slush , ",
            " your feet and legs would n't feel a thing .\nI normally do n't have to break Timberlands in , ",
            " but this pair did take a few days ",
            " before they formed properly to my feet .\nAnywho .\nVery satisfied ."

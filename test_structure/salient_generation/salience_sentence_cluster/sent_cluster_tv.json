            " I really need a 1080p PC monitor , ",
            " I purchased this at .",

            "First off , ",
            " after reading so many reviews for the Sharp 70 '' ",
            " which I was so close to buying , ",

            " that actually require professionals to come to the house ",
            " to calibrate the image ",
            " because buyers just ca n't make it look good no matter what they do .\nMany of those ",
            " complaining about this were seemingly `` qualified '' ",
            " to make the adjustments , ",
            " what Sharp is doing with their model numbers ",
            " but I swear , ",
            " I had to ",
            " and I think ",
            " there were like 8 70 '' ",
            " even though they all had the same comments ",
            " regarding not being able to adjust the picture ",
            " to look good at all .\nBy the time I was done with hours and hours of research over about 2 weeks , I basically gave up .\nThat 's ",
            " why I was so happy to find the 70 '' Vizio .\nI may provide updates in the future .\nI 've only ",
            " had the TV ",
            " running for about a week ",
            " so I can only comment on so much at this point .\nIf you have questions for me , ",
            " or if you want me to test something for you , ",
            " post a message ",
            " and I 'll reply .\nOn CNET I read ",
            " because they fixed an issue the 70 '' models ",

            " not being true .\nThat 's important to me ",
            " but I kept the faith ",

            " and I think ",
            " it 's more of a size issue ",
            " because I noticed the same thing on the Sharps ",
            " and was very bright .\nThe 70 '' Sharp ",
            " that I contemplated buying ",
            " that 's just a hue , like the bluish ",

            " running the same shows and the Samsung white is white ",

            " that would make sense .\nI even turned the contrast , backlighting , and brightness to 100 % on the Vizio ",
            " and it was still bluish .\nHowever , oddly enough , ",
            " while playing my PS3 , ",
            " I noticed ",
            " that might cause the bluish hue to come from size ",
            " -LRB- but it still seems apparent to me ",
            " that can impact picture quality , ",
            " I 'm almost left with the thought , ",
            " weighing in to what ",

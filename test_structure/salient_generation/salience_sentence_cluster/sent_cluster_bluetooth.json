            " I was pretty satisfied , ",
            " and I looked forward to putting the Jaybirds through their paces in my gym .\nWhen I arrived for my workout the next day , ",

            " that I had my iPhone in my pocket ",

            " being that I do n't find it safe to keep my iPhone in my pocket ",

            " but I gave the headphones one more shot during my next workout ",

            " that this is simply a function of Bluetooth products , ",
            " because that 's not true .\nI owned a pair of Logitech BT headphones , ",
            " that I could leave my iPhone at one end of my gym ",

            " they fit decent ",
            " so I have to suggest ",
            " the headset does not support voice ",
            " dialing basically ",

            " if they had plans for an upgrade ",

            " they told me flat out no , ",
            " despite trying to experiment with repositioning it ",
            " which is ok ",

            " but soon used them everyday while ",
            " working to work .\nIt took a while ",
            " to get the earpiece ",
            " to fit to the point ",
            " that they did not work themselves out of the ear while running , ",
            " but after about 3 or 4 runs , i was able to get them adjusted to the point ",

            " when you turn them on to press `` 0000 '' ",

            " and switching right over to streaming from my phone ",
            " without any trouble .\n-LRB- and in case you 're wondering , yes , you can have both your phone and these headphones Bluetooth ",
            " paired to your MOTOACTV simultaneously ",
            " to listen to music ",
            " and get all your phone notifications at the same time -RRB-\n- They are fairly small .\nThese look much bigger in the product photo .\nThey are actually reasonably small ",
            " and are partially obscured by your ears ",
            " -LRB- see my user photo -RRB- .\nYou do n't have to look like as big of a dork ",
            " as the product photo makes ",
            " but I keep both my phone and my MOTOACTV at my waist ",
            " but it 's black and red like the headphones and stylish .\nIt would be nice ",
            " if it had a lanyard or something ",
            " to make sure ",
            " it does n't accidentally get dropped ",

            " -LRB- MFB -RRB- ",
            " using the headphones , ",
            " and of course you can just adjust volume on your phone or MOTOACTV ",

            " the MFB will play/pause with one press , skip forward with two , ",
            " and go back with three presses .\nThe bad :\n- These are really hard to put on .\nIt takes me like 30 seconds ",
            " but I struggle with this every time .\n- They get uncomfortable after a while .\nBecause they 're hanging over your ears , ",
            " they suffer from that syndrome ",
            " that these over-the-ear earbuds tend to have , ",
            " which is ",
            " that after a while they start hurting .\n- They feel a little loose ",
            " when running .\nThey 're fine ",
            " if walking or doing something ",
            " that does n't involve a lot of bouncing around , ",
            " but while running they seem ",

            " like I 'm going to have to reach up ",
            " and grab them , ",
            " but they just feel insecure ... ",
            " but I guess ",
            " that 's kind of an issue with any pair of earbuds ",
            " that does n't push in ",
            " or anything , ",
            " to describe ",

            " or something like that -RRB- , ",
            " but after that you kind of have to play a guessing game .\nMiscellaneous :\n- The manual does n't tell you what to look for , ",
            " so ",
            " when you 're ",
            " charging these , ",

            " is finished .\nThese also come with their own charger ",

            " - -RRB- ",
            " and if you use the MOTOACTV ",
            " you 'll like ",
            " that they are designed ",
            " to match the look and minimalism of the unit .\nHowever , it 's up to you ",
            " if you want to pay $ 130 for some headphones .\nI 've done my best to outline the pros and cons above , ",

            " This is n't an issue ",

            " that might not be an issue , ",
            " but since it 's free to rotate they just flop over my ears ",

            "I 'm comparing these to the Jabra Sport ",
            " which are way better in many ways in my opinion , ",
            " which I 'll explain .\nThese are hard to get into and over your ears .\nThe earbuds do twist ",
            " but its difficult to do ",
            " which I like better than the Jabra .\nThe reason is ",
            " that ",
            " when moving and twisting your neck the jabra 's stick to your skin ",
            " if your sweaty and the Motorola 's do not .\nPairing on both was super simple ",

            " but it hurts your ears .\nJabra does n't do that , it stays at the volume level ",
            " so my preference is with the Jabra .\nI wish ",
            " there was a way ",
            " to have a few things from the SF and a few from the Jabra ",
            " which would make them a near perfect ",
            " set at least for me .\nThe jabra 's look more like Apple earbuds ",
            " so there are no rubber buds ",
            " to fit .\nIts also been my experience ",
            " that the rubber buds ",
            " that the SF have can get ",

            " it immediately connects to both headsets .\nThe only problem ",
            " I 'm ",
            " having with the two devices now is how to determine ",
            " which phone will be used ",
            " when I use a phone command , ",
            " I think ",
            " it has something ",
            " to do with the order ",
            " I 've connected the phones , ",
            " so I do n't think this ",

            " there is an indicator in the top right of the iPhone ",
            " that shows the Jabra 's battery life .\nI can also press the voice button ",
            " and say `` Battery '' ",
            " it 's really nice ",
            " being able to talk to the headset ",
            " to get the headset to do ",

            " once I get the hang of it ",

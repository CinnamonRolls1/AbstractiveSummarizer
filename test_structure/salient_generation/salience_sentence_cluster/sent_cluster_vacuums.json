            "If you 're ",
            " looking to do away with your broom and dust mop like me , ",
            " without the directions - ",
            " why someone would buy this to use it on carpet ",
            " to be sure , ",
            " because I did n't want something ",
            " -LRB- and some earplugs - ",
            " it 's pretty loud -RRB- , ",
            " that says it blows , ",
            " I guess ",
            " I can see how he/she might think so , ",
            " however it blows straight out in front - up kind of high , ",
            " and since I usually tip the vacuum back ",
            " as I 'm working , ",
            " it was n't an issue for me , ",
            " because it blew the exhaust up .\nIf you hold it straight up and down as you 're working - ",
            " which I think ",
            " would be really awkward , ",
            " you might have a problem , ",
            " but I 'm pretty sure most people vacuum with their vacuum at an angle ",
            " like I do .\nI do n't know , ",
            " that blew its exhaust out downward .\nAs for the vac ",
            " being a 4-star versus a 5-star , the reviewer ",
            " that was upset about the awkwardness of it , ",
            " he/she was spot-on .\nIt will not lock upright , ",
            " which stinks to me .\nIf you want to detach and use the hose , ",
            " you would have ",
            " to keep one hand on the vacuum ",
            " to keep it from tipping over , ",
            " because it IS quite top-heavy .\nAll in all , it 's a keeper , though , ",
            " as I 'll be using my carpet vacuum for those kinds of jobs , anyway .",
            "I do n't know ",
            " but I have been ",
            " using it for a studio apartment ",
            " and picks up the dirt ",
            " that I intended it to clean .\nIt does lock upright , ",
            " but it 's very subtle , ",
            " something this vacuum is not intended for .\nIf that is the case , the rating ",
            " so I figured ",
            " -LRB- at least that 's what I figured -RRB- .\nIf you need to be bringing vacuum from one place to another , or up and down a staircase , ",
            " since it 's very light and small .\nBut ",
            " because it 's light and small , ",
            " it 's easy to tip ",
            " over when you try to use the back tube , ",
            " and the people ",
            " will find this vacuum ",
            " to be flimsy .\nIf you do n't need to carry the vacuum around , ",
            " The cord is made much thinner ",
            " to be retractable ",
            " the length needs to be shorter ",
            " to avoid tangling .\nYou will need to decide ",
            " it 's enough ",
            " or punch hole dots ",
            " but ",
            " it 's just right .\nThat ",
            " being said , ",
            " it 's also good ",
            " if you are ",
            " that you do n't want to be sucked by the vacuum .\n4 .\nThe Vent and Balancing : ",
            " The vacuum is supposed to be used fairly tilted .\nBecause of this , ",
            " if you try to use it fairly upright , ",
            " you 'll find the vacuum hard to navigate ",
            " As other ratings noted , ",
            " where the dirt is collected ",
            " so ",
            " if you can live with it , ",
            " it might do good for you .\n6 .\nDirt Collecting Canister : ",
            " I think ",
            " : I do n't think ",
            " even if it means I need to clean it out more often , ",
            " because I like the vacuum ",
            " it has now .\nIf this vacuum is to get one improvement , ",
            " who shed heavily ",
            " and this vacuum ",
            " worked amazingly well ",
            " at keeping my floors ",
            " -LRB- and chairs , futon , and sometimes clothing ",
            " if I could n't find my lint roller -RRB- ",
            " and I found ",
            " when I moved ",
            " that I really needed a beater bar ",
            " for cleaning upholstery , ",
            " and also it worked well on my linoleum floors in the bathroom and kitchen .\nThe only downside , ",
            " which other reviewers mentioned , ",
            " is that every use ",
            " -LRB- remember , ",
            " significantly decreased the suction , ",
            " so I found ",
            " I had to empty the canister ",
            " -LRB- bagless , yay ! -RRB- ",
            " after each use , ",
            " and knock the dirt/hair out of the filter about once a month ",
            " -LRB- I used the vac a couple times a week -RRB- , ",
            " and rinse the filter clean maybe every other month .\nIt was a bit of a pain , ",
            " but I found this regimen ",
            " for cleaning the vacuum well worth the trade ",
            " for how clean it got my apartment !",
            "I purchased the Shark Stick Vac for use at our church .\nWe had been ",
            " using an upright for our cleaning ",
            " and some of our members were complaining about its weight .\nWell , there are no more complaints about weight and nothing ",
            " but raves about the Sharks cleaning ability .\nAnd ",
            " to top it off , ",
            "We installed laminate with a groove ",
            " without leaving marks ",
            " and is very essy to use .\nMy only complaint would be ",
            " but overall it is great .\nI am buying one for each of my daughters for Christmas .\nShark Retractor Stick Vacuum - EP604"

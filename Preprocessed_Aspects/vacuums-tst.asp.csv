0,I have never hated a product more than this one.,5
1,It is so loud,4
2,that it hurts your ears.,4
3,The dirt is just blown around,7
4,and you spend all of your time revacuuming spots.,7
5,I am getting rid of it.,5
6,Don't waste your money!!!,5
7,This stick vac is powerful alright.,7
8,The problem is,5
9,that the opening on the bottom of the unit is too small.,5
10,"Forget about corners,",5
11,unless you are positioned right over,5
12,what you intend to vacuum,5
13,it won't get sucked up.,7
14,It is way too loud and blows all of the dog hair and dirt all over the floor.,4
15,I am returning it an,5
16,getting something else!,5
17,The Power Stick has great suction,7
18,but the opening is only about 3 inches wide,5
19,so it takes longer to clean a room then,5
20,it would with some other products.,5
21,It does a good job though with cat hair and bits of kitty litter.,5
22,The noise,4
23,that others complain about,4
24,doesn't bother me but my cat runs and hides,4
25,whenever I turn it on.,5
26,It's very lightweight,8
27,but I wish,0
28,the handle was a little longer.,0
29,I find myself stooping a bit,3
30,when I use,5
31,it and I'm only 5 ' 4 ''.,5
32,"I love this vacuum for quick clean ups,",5
33,of which I have many.,5
34,I have two dogs and a cat,5
35,so there's always hair and litter somewhere.. this is a quick alternative,5
36,to pulling out the big vacuum.,5
37,"It's very light weight,",8
38,works well,5
39,and has a nice long cord.,3
40,The only downside is,5
41,"that unlike the big vacuum, there's no skinny attachment to get into the corners.. but it's a small downside,",0
42,I just gab the dust buster or broom to compensate.,5
43,I am able to vacuum more often,5
44,(my `` big '' vacuum,5
45,is really big and powerful,5
46,and heavy..),5
47,"and more quickly, so all in all",5
48,it helps trendmously.,5
49,It works.,5
50,Strong power for a small device.,7
51,I bought it for my laminate floors,5
52,because I researched,5
53,that you should not use a vacuum with a beater bar on these floors.,5
54,I just installed the floors,5
55,and wanted to protect them.,5
56,"As far as loud, yeah it's pretty loud, but nothing unbearable.",4
57,I think,5
58,some people can be just too sensitive.,5
59,Probably not louder than a regular vacuum.,4
60,But I bought it for the power.,7
61,I want it to work and not be weak.,7
62,"So far, it delivers.",7
63,Great for the price.,6
64,I have had this vacuum for approximately 4 months,5
65,and it has been nothing but trouble.,5
66,"It does have excellent suction however,",7
67,I spend more time replacing the belt,1
68,or taking the entire thing apart to dislodge a clog in the tubes,1
69,that consists of nothing larger than lint and hair.,5
70,When the tubes get clogged,5
71,(which is very often),5
72,the only way,5
73,you can tell,5
74,is,5
75,that instead of sucking the dirt into the canister it blows it all over the room.,5
76,This is the worst experience with an appliance,5
77,I have ever had.,5
78,I will NEVER buy another Bissell.,5
79,Well I have had this vaccum for just over a month,1
80,and it has died on me.,1
81,I was using it,5
82,and the brush on the inside stopped spinning,1
83,(the clear front allows you to see the brush,5
84,moving,5
85,"while it is vaccuming,",5
86,to see the dirt,5
87,I suppose),5
88,and an awful burning rubber smelled came from it.,5
89,I checked all over for clogs or something,5
90,wrapped around the inside,5
91,but found nothing.,5
92,Also it is very loud,4
93,compared to my old vaccum.,5
94,Until now the noise was my only complaint.,4
95,I need to get another one,5
96,and it won't be a bissell.,5
97,I should start by saying,5
98,that my last,5
99,(and only),5
100,vacuum,5
101,before this was a canister.,5
102,"Maybe I shouldn't expect this to perform as well on hard floor, I don't know.",5
103,This cleaned the carpet really well and,7
104,-- like the other reviewers said,5
105,--,5
106,pulled up a shocking amount of crud and dust.,7
107,"The hardwood was another matter, though.",5
108,"It seemed to do an almost adequate job on small crummy stuff,",7
109,but would not pick up anything rice krispy size ir bigger.,7
110,"As a mother of 4 small kids, I need a vacuum",5
111,that will pick cereal bits and other food crumbs.,5
112,This also performed better on the tile and vinyl floors that on the hardwood.,7
113,I would not recommend this,5
114,if your house,5
115,(like mine),5
116,is mostly hardwood.,5
117,"If you have wall-to-wall carpet in most of the house, though,",5
118,this would be a good choice.,5
119,Good vacuum.,5
120,Easy assembly with just one screw.,3
121,"Not as noisy as the Hoover monster it replaced, good tools",4
122,that really work on upolstry.,0
123,Real long cord gets around the house.,3
124,It's fun,5
125,to watch the little red,5
126,a green light tell you,0
127,when the floor is clean.,0
128,Filters?,0
129,I guess,0
130,we got,0
131,"ta have them now,",0
132,but they do need attention.,0
133,This was definitely a good purchase so far...,5
134,I love this vacuum.,5
135,It's not too noisy,4
136,and it does a great job.,7
137,The dirt sensor works so well.,0
138,"Usually, I just vacuum along,",5
139,making sure to get the visible dirt.,5
140,"With the dirt sensor, I know",0
141,I'm getting the carpet clean.,0
142,I couldn't believe,5
143,how much dirt I got out of the carpets the first time,5
144,I used it!,5
145,I also like how well it fluffs up the pile of the carpet.,5
146,This little vacuum would be great,5
147,if it ACTUALLY vacuumed up anything.,7
148,"Does a poor job on my wood floors, my old fashioned broom does a better job.",7
149,"As for carpeting, doesn't pick up anything.",7
150,And pet hair?,7
151,Forget it.,5
152,A big waste of money.,5
153,I'd rate,5
154,it zero stars,5
155,"if I could,",5
156,I 'm,5
157,tossing it.,5
158,I had this vacuum for 2 years,5
159,"and it still works,",5
160,but I can't use it.,5
161,The handle was always a weak point and it eventually broke -,1
162,so I have been,5
163,using it duct,5
164,"taped together,",5
165,which was ok,5
166,until the area,1
167,"where the bottom connects to the body also broke,",1
168,rendering it useless.,1
169,I am going to have to add it to a landfill,5
170,and buy a new one.,5
171,I am disappointed,5
172,since it was nice and light - good for carrying up to our loft and small enough,8
173,to fit in the closet and powerful enough,7
174,to clean up cat hair.,7
175,This is the second Shark stick vac,5
176,I have owned.,5
177,My first one worked great for about 5 years.,5
178,Towards the end of its run it wouldn't suck very well,5
179,and was consistently getting clogged.,5
180,In the end the motor burned out.,5
181,This vac is great for tile and hardwood floors,5
182,so we purchased another one.,5
183,Well it seem to be that,5
184,"after only using this product for over a month, Im",1
185,having the same issues with it already.,1
186,I guess,5
187,when you purchase,5
188,this stick vac,5
189,you are,5
190,taking your chances.,5
191,Good Luck!!,5
192,My wife finds her new Shark Vacuum better,5
193,then the first one we purchased.,5
194,"It is quite,",4
195,and seems to vacuum better then the first one.,7
196,Also the retractable cord is a plus.,3
197,For the price we think,6
198,this was a great buy.,6
199,"Also the shipping time was great,",5
200,we received the product a couple of days early.,5
201,Have a great week.,5
202,"Finally, somebody out there got it right.",5
203,"A small, light-weight appliance that can do a big job.",8
204,"I was getting tired of lugging heavy, cumbersome vacuums up and down the stairs",5
205,and thought,5
206,I'd look for a more practical alternative.,5
207,I found one in the Shark.,5
208,I recommend it highly.,5
209,"From carpet to floor, it does an excellent job.",5
210,Clean the filter regularly and it this little vacuum won't let you down.,0
211,I recently bought an Altima Model 2981BVZ.,5
212,This vacuum is the most flawed piece of machinery,5
213,I have ever had the misfortune,5
214,of using.,5
215,Every 3 minutes I have to clean the foam filter.,0
216,I clean more out of the foam filter,5
217,than I do out of the dust cup.,5
218,The hose attachments have very little power.,0
219,I am sadly disappointed in the quality.,1
220,"Too bulky, cord is unusually stiff and tangles are impossible to remove.",3
221,Mine picks up animal hair,7
222,but it does spit out a lot of dirt.,7
223,The attachments are not useful.,0
224,"You do have to clean out filters often,",0
225,"but they're filters,",0
226,you should want them clean.,0
227,"Would I buy another like it,",5
228,heck no!,5
229,Eureka s are not what they used to be.,5
230,This vacuum picks up very well...,7
231,until of course the filters get blocked,0
232,and then you have to wash them out.,0
233,Oh yes.. and after about 1 year of use the back wheel fell off -,1
234,haven't been able to find replacement part,5
235,to keep the wheel on.,5
236,Gave up and just bought a Dyson Dc-17.,5
237,I love this vacuum!,5
238,I have a cat,5
239,and it gets all the hair.,5
240,The claw is a great attachment.,0
241,"The only problem is the duster,",0
242,which doesn't spin,0
243,and keeps falling off,0
244,while I'm cleaning.,0
245,Just put it in a closet,5
246,and keep cleaning...,5
247,this is a great buy!,5
248,"I, too, bought the yellow Walmart model 2981BVZ",5
249,after my 10 year old Hoover Windtunnel died.,5
250,I must say,5
251,I am impressed with this vacuum,5
252,"even though it only cost about $ 80,",6
253,compared with almost $ 300 for my Hoover.,5
254,"It cleans remarkably well, as well",7
255,"as my old Hoover did,",5
256,"it is quieter than my Hoover,",4
257,"the telescoping dust brush DOES work,",0
258,and it is so convenient,3
259,to empty the dust cup,3
260,without having to clean the filter each time.,3
261,"True, it isn't self-propelled,",3
262,but it is relatively light for its size and fairly easy to push around.,8
263,"And the Turbo Paw works absolutely great, especially on stairs.",0
264,The only minor flaw,5
265,"I experienced is,",5
266,"as others have noted,",5
267,the extension wand falls off,5
268,"when bumped,",5
269,but I am working on a fix for this,5
270,"and in the meantime, it doesn't detract from the cleaning power of the vacuum.",7
271,I love it.,5
272,"While the suction is very good,",7
273,the `` power nozzle '' is a piece of junk.,5
274,We've had two now,1
275,and they quit working,1
276,just after the warranty runs out,1
277,(90 days).,5
278,A call to Eletrolux customer service will convince you they have no customer service.,2
279,E-mails get you nowhere.,2
280,We will never buy another eletrolux product.,5
281,Made in China says,5
282,it all!,5
283,Had this vacuum 2 years.,5
284,It died,5
285,while I was vacuuming.,5
286,Pros : is,5
287,it is quieter than my old hoover.,4
288,Cons :,5
289,the cord is too short,3
290,and didn't retract well.,5
291,Bags fill up quickly,0
292,as they are small and expensive.,6
293,It is hard to control,3
294,when pulling.,3
295,The floor attachment is to big.,0
296,The attachments are easily knocked off the wand.,0
297,I wouldn't recommend this vacuum.,5
298,The vacuum works really well to clean medium to low carpet in my apartment!,7
299,It is quiet,4
300,so I can clean at night,4
301,and not disturb my neighbor up and below my room.,4
302,The only problem,3
303,I found so far,5
304,(using for 2 months),5
305,is,3
306,that it doesn't turn very well.,3
307,You have to do quite a bit of lifting and repositioning the vaccum,3
308,to turn the unit.,3
309,I like this electrolux ;,5
310,it works well,5
311,and it cleans thoroughly.,7
312,It is a little tricky,3
313,learning how to manuver it ;,3
314,it's not as easy as the old traditional electrolux,3
315,I've used for years.,5
316,It takes a little,3
317,getting used to it ;,3
318,that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.,5
319,The handle is a little thick and slightly difficult to use.,3
320,The machine works very well,5
321,and the house feels so clean,5
322,after I use it.,5
323,Electrolux products are excellent ;,5
324,I used my last electrolux for over 30 years,5
325,and it's still running.,5
326,Everything written in the reviews,5
327,is true.,5
328,I wanted to go back to a canister,5
329,and was looking around at Sears,5
330,and saw this model,5
331,clearanced at $ 231.,6
332,I was a little nervous,5
333,buying it,5
334,because I had done zero research on the product.,5
335,I've used electrolux in the past,5
336,and always liked it.,5
337,I've also used Kirby and Hoover uprights.,5
338,I am thrilled with the electrolux.,5
339,"It's powerful, lightweight and maneuvers beautifully under beds, around corners and tight spots.",3
340,"For the price I paid,",6
341,I am beyond excited.,6
342,I had our first Miele 25 years,5
343,and had to replace only,5
344,when the universal bags didn't provide a tight seal,5
345,and kept coming unattached.,5
346,I had expected at least as good from this model.,5
347,It was not to be.,5
348,I can not even use the power head,0
349,because no one can get it off or on.,0
350,The issue has become more of a problem,5
351,as time goes on.,5
352,At first it was difficult to remove,0
353,but now it won't even attach to the wand.,0
354,The design of this newer version is poor,5
355,and certainly wasn't trialed,5
356,before it went into manufacturing.,5
357,The tools were previously stored inside the canister,0
358,and were easily accessed.,0
359,"Now they sit on top,",5
360,are in the way,5
361,and cheaply made.,1
362,The support for the wand,0
363,is now on the opposite end of the carrying,0
364,handle making it impossible to carry unless the wand is carried separately.,3
365,Difficult when carrying up and down stairs.,3
366,"Yes, it does a good job",7
367,picking up dog hair,7
368,but that's the only thing,5
369,that performs as promised.,5
370,My wife and I,5
371,(in our 60s),5
372,bought this Titan after all the positive reviews.,5
373,We have found,5
374,that it is quite heavy,8
375,to move around and constantly overturns,8
376,because of its balance.,3
377,"It can not remove much from oriental carpets,",7
378,and the hard floor tool moves animal hair around instead of collecting it.,5
379,I'm going to sell ours,5
380,and go back to Kenmore.,5
381,After having other vacuum cleaners,5
382,only last for less than 2 years I am hoping,5
383,that this will last at least 5.,5
384,If it does,5
385,I would give it 4 stars.,5
386,Positive :,5
387,"It's very light, quiet and easy to move.",4
388,"Negative : The cable is too short,",3
389,the electric power head for carpet not very wide and powerful and it tips over easily.,0
390,The utensil tray is so-so.,0
391,Changing the length of the tube requires some fiddling.,0
392,"At almost $ 600 I would have expected better,",6
393,especially considering,5
394,that Miele sells comparable units in Europe for $ 300 -,5
395,$ 400.,5
396,So far this Miele Titan Canister is,5
397,just what I was looking for.,5
398,I am very excited about the outcome of this new purchase.,5
399,I read a lot of reviews,5
400,and chose this product over others.,5
401,It has really good suction,7
402,and is quiet.,4
403,"I have wide pine floors with area rugs,",5
404,and the parquet floor brush and the power brush do a really nice job.,0
405,"In addition, it is light and easy to carry around",8
406,-- and it picks up kitty litter!,5
407,This vac may not be for everyone.,5
408,It has it's shortcomings,5
409,but I believe,5
410,that's because we Americans expect a lot of convenience in our products.,5
411,"The bag hold very little,",0
412,it has 3 wheels,3
413,"and is unsteady,",3
414,"the on-off controls are only on the base,",3
415,"the cord is short, NOW...",3
416,"... the suction settings are very convenient,",5
417,"the various attachments really do their job,",0
418,"it's quiet,",4
419,and best of all this vac does the job,5
420,"that it was intended to do,",5
421,it sucks like no other vacuum,7
422,that I have ever had.,7
423,Before using it the first time I vacuumed my whole house with my old vac,5
424,and then proceeded,5
425,to use the Miele.,5
426,"Wow, I was shocked at how much dirt, dust, animal hair, etc.",7
427,that it picked up.,7
428,I love this vacuum,5
429,and would have no other.,5
430,I honestly can't say enough good about this vacuum.,5
431,I'd recommend it over and over again as long as I also shared the shortcomings.,5
432,I ordered the Hoover handheld canister vacuum,5
433,because the review on it was good.,5
434,"I paid extra to get it the next day,",2
435,which it did.,2
436,When I opened the box of tools several of them were missing.,0
437,I emailed Amazon,2
438,but never got a reply,2
439,regarding what can be done,2
440,to replace the missing and essential tools.,2
441,After paying over $ 100,6
442,to get this vacuum I,6
443,would expect some sort of reply from someone.,2
444,I am very disappointed in Amazon and Hoover for their poor quality control.,2
445,I would have returned the whole thing,5
446,"but the vac works fine, I just had to work with some old parts",5
447,so it could do,5
448,what I boulght it for.,5
449,I guess,5
450,the word quality and customer service no longer exist.,2
451,This vacuum works great,5
452,but it is so loud I can not even get through vacuuming my tile floors.,4
453,"I even tried putting ear plugs in to vacuum with it,",4
454,but it still hurts my ears.,4
455,I am going to have to return it,5
456,and find something,5
457,that runs more quietly.,5
458,Any suggestions out there?,5
459,I love this vacuum -,5
460,it is light -,8
461,it is powerful,7
462,and works wonderfully.,5
463,"Great to get in small corners, counters, furniture.",3
464,There is one small -,5
465,could be come major problem.,5
466,The plastic extensions tend to shatter,0
467,if dropped onto a hard surface.,0
468,One of the extensions barely fits,0
469,and I am afraid,0
470,that this could become unusable very soon.,0
471,It is a huge disappoint,5
472,as I love it otherwise!,5
473,Otherwise I would give it 5 stars -,5
474,but I am afraid,5
475,I may not be able to use it before long.,5
476,I have my own cleaning business,5
477,and was looking for a vacuum,5
478,that would do everything,5
479,but unfortunately I just couldn't find it.,5
480,So in order to go from hard floors to carpet I had to invest in two different vacs.,5
481,I love my Shark for Carpet,5
482,and originally purchased a backpack vacuum,5
483,which only lasted me two years,5
484,before the motor went out.,5
485,I did not want another backpack,5
486,because it was just too heavy,5
487,but liked the concept,5
488,because I don't like canister vacs.,5
489,Based on reviews I went with this one for $ 75.,6
490,The suction is amazing,7
491,and does,5
492,exactly what I wanted it too.,5
493,"I only have two drawbacks on this vac, one",5
494,I'm tall,3
495,and the wand is a bit short for me,3
496,but there's only a few jobs,5
497,I have,5
498,that I need this little beauty,5
499,for so it's perfect.,5
500,"Brush head is small,",0
501,my old one doesn't fit on this,0
502,and was twice as wide.,0
503,Going to see,5
504,if they sell additional attachments to suit my needs.,0
505,I needed a small vacuum,5
506,to complete cleaning more efficiently and easily.,5
507,My old one quit and,5
508,"as I had added a new motor to it last year,",5
509,I decided to look for a new one.,5
510,I looked at every small but powerful vacuum,5
511,I could find in stores and on line.,5
512,"Because I live in a rural area,",5
513,I could not find the Hoover,5
514,I selected.,5
515,I wanted to lift and check the convenience,5
516,of handling it before purchase,5
517,but could not at that,5
518,time so I ordered it from Amazon.,5
519,"I was delighted with the handling of this vacuum,",3
520,it is so easy to maneuver.,3
521,I had also wanted to be sure,7
522,it had good suction and the ability,7
523,to clean really well,7
524,and was well satisfied.,7
525,At first it was a great vacuum.,5
526,Then the motor became unbearably loud.,4
527,I used it in an enclosed room,4
528,and my ears started ringing,4
529,because it was so loud.,4
530,Eventually I started listening to my iPod,5
531,whenever I vacuumed.,5
532,Then the engine completely stopped vacuuming.,1
533,There is an 800 number,2
534,I have to call to get them to replace it,2
535,but I'm afraid,2
536,they may charge me shipping +,2
537,I don't have the big giant box anymore.,5
538,They want you to take it to one of 5 vacuum repairers in NY,2
539,and I'm not going all the way to Sea Girt Long Island,2
540,to have them repair it.,2
541,It does have plenty of power and suction.,7
542,It is light weight and easy to maneuver.,8
543,The bad is that,5
544,if you have the new shag style thick pyle carpet,3
545,then you will see how hard this vacuum is to use.,3
546,You have to hold it at a very uncomfortable angle,3
547,since there is not height adjustment.,3
548,The height adjustment is the angle,3
549,you put on he handle.,3
550,That's just weird for me.,5
551,So you have to have the right handle angle combination for it to not hang up on the thick carpet.,3
552,I am in the process,5
553,of trying to return it to the company,5
554,I bought it from as his is a lot of money to spend on something,6
555,that isn't easily usable on my carpet.,6
556,I really like,5
557,that its smaller than my old Bistle & LOVE,3
558,that I have no longer need,0
559,to wrap up the cord.,0
560,I bought,5
561,as I have two cats.,5
562,I have a wooden trip along the base of my carpet,5
563,"seperating it from the wall,",5
564,this unit claimed,3
565,to get down deep in the ridges yet I dont see that happening.,3
566,I went over an area with this one then with my old one,5
567,and there was still stuff,5
568,coming up off carpet.,5
569,I dont love it as much,5
570,as I thought but do like the idea of its multiple filters,0
571,and hope,5
572,that with more uses it willl keep my floors clean.,5
573,"I will be trying the pet tool attachment soon,",0
574,that should be alot better than just the hose on regular vacuums.,0
575,"Out of the box I liked the physical feel of the vacuum,",1
576,all the components are well built.,1
577,The filter and dirt compartment is easily detachable,0
578,and cleaned.,0
579,The vacuum,5
580,itself is compact and easily,5
581,stored.,5
582,The electric cord is retractable,0
583,and is conveniently,3
584,hidden when not in use.,3
585,The various attachments are of good quality,0
586,and attach easily to the vacuum.,0
587,The vacuum itself has strong suction power,7
588,and is able to quickly pick up dirt and other grime off the floor and walls.,7
589,One thing,5
590,I dislike about this vacuum,5
591,is,5
592,that it emits a strong odor every-time,1
593,I'm done,1
594,using it.,1
595,Very agile and light to maneuver.,8
596,High powered suction + hepa filter = ultra clean rug.,7
597,"For this price point, great value for quality you get.",6
598,Extremely pleased with Panasonic's vac.,5
599,Thank you.,5
600,The floor accessory fell apart and,0
601,when I tried to reattach it the handle shattered.,0
602,"This vacuum is cheaply made,",1
603,doesn't have strong suction,7
604,and all accessories are constructed of flimsy plastic.,0
605,Not a quality machine and not worth the price.,6
606,JUNK!!!!,5
607,"After a few times of use, the plastic",1
608,that connects the telescopic wand to the handle,1
609,cracked,1
610,and broke.,1
611,Gluing,5
612,it failed to hold it,5
613,and eventually it broke off,1
614,rendering it totally useless.,1
615,"Samsung is a good company,",5
616,but clearly they used cheap plastic on this area,1
617,because a search on Google revealed some others,5
618,who had the same problem.,5
619,I have contacted customer care,2
620,and they have promised,2
621,to get back to me in 2 business days.,2
622,Not so sure,5
623,"if they will fix it for free,",5
624,because someone in Customer Care told me they don't fix it for free,2
625,if it has a physical damage.,2
626,Overall a great product but 2 problems :,5
627,"1. like many other reviews, plastic on the telescopic pole is not strong enough",1
628,and broke.,1
629,"Still cleaning, but have to always pay attention not to definitely break it.",5
630,2,5
631,The most annoying : very noisy after 6 months of use.,4
632,My kids leave the room,5
633,when I'm getting close...,5
634,"That wasn't an issue at the beginning,",5
635,actually it was quiet but now it's very annoying.,4
636,"Samsung is working on it right now, no vaccum cleaner for 2 weeks, still waiting...",2
637,Will keep,5
638,you posted,5
639,Pros -,5
640,It's light and easy to handle.,8
641,Picks up cat hair and kitty litter easily.,7
642,Cons -,5
643,Wish the handle would stay upright instead of falling over,3
644,when I release it.,5
645,"Also, sometimes the kitty litter catches below the canister",5
646,and falls out,5
647,when I go to empty it.,5
648,Neither is a deal breaker for me.,5
649,Every time,5
650,when I use this vacuum I love it more and more.,5
651,I was a little bit in shock,5
652,when I opened the box,5
653,and I saw the brush.,5
654,It had the size more than I had expected.,5
655,I was concerned,5
656,that It would be heavy.,8
657,"However, the power of the vacuum and its design take care of it :",7
658,it pushes the brush itself.,3
659,It is easy to move because of the adjustable wheels on the side of the brush.,3
660,It fits under my Quin bed.,5
661,"The sides "" wrapped "" with protective rubber like rim",1
662,which prevents wearing and tearing the plastic parts on the brush,1
663,and bumping and scratching furniture.,1
664,The suction is excellent and adjustable to my needs.,7
665,This vacuum was good for the first few months,5
666,except that hair never gets in the dust bin,5
667,but all wraps around the brush,3
668,and is very difficult to be taking off all the time.,3
669,NOW only seven months after I bought it the brush doesn't turn anymore so is no longer any good for the carpet.,0
670,I will never buy another Hoover product...,5
671,EVER!,5
672,I have not yet tried the company for help so,5
673,but plan to try soon.,5
674,I was happy with this vacuum for the most part,5
675,until it quit working.,1
676,The brush needs to be cleaned out almost every time,3
677,you use it,3
678,because all hair gets tangles,3
679,and stuck to the brush bristles.,3
680,"I have cleaned the filter twice,",0
681,and I empty the canister twice during each use.,0
682,The vacuum recently overheated and the motor stopped working.,1
683,After cleaning the filters again,5
684,"and letting the vacuum sit unused for 24 hours,",5
685,the motor seems to be working.,5
686,Now the vacuum will no longer sit flat on the floor,1
687,"while in use, it stays tilted",1
688,and therefore can't vacuum anything off the floor.,1
689,It says,5
690,"it has a 5 year warranty,",2
691,but the closest repair shop is a two hour drive away.,2
692,"I haven't been able to vacuum for two weeks,",5
693,and I'm EXTREMELY frustrated!,5
694,If I have to spend $ 100 in gas,5
695,"to drive to a repair shop,",5
696,I suppose,5
697,I may as well buy a new vacuum.,5
698,I guess,5
699,I should've paid for the Dyson.,5
700,Uggh.,5
701,I did a lot of research,5
702,before buying this vacuum.,5
703,Dyson always has the best review,5
704,but it's too expensive for me.,5
705,This one seems to be somewhat light-weight,8
706,and have powerful suction.,7
707,"However, it's dispointing.",5
708,The suction is pretty powerful.,7
709,"However, it's very heavy.",8
710,Way more heavier than I expected.,8
711,And it's not very steerable.,3
712,The host is short,0
713,and takes a lot of strength,0
714,to stratch it.,0
715,The dust bin spins dirt around for my first use.,0
716,"However, it can't spin anything after second use.",0
717,I'd suggest spend a little more,5
718,to get a Dyson.,5
719,I have had this vacuum for 3 months now.,5
720,Overall very pleased!,5
721,It is light weight and easy to maneuver.,8
722,The transition from carpet to hard wood floors is smooth.,3
723,I have a 3 bedroom home with a small dog,5
724,and I vacuum at least once a week.,5
725,The dirt canister usually has to be emptied one or twice,0
726,before entire house is done,0
727,but it is no a problem.,0
728,The only reason,5
729,i am not giving 5 stars,5
730,is due to attachments...,0
731,"to use,",5
732,the user must disconnect from one source,0
733,and reconnect into new outlet.,0
734,It is a extra step but not a deal breaker.,5
735,It is an exceptional value for the price.,6
736,Excellent vacuum and good price.,6
737,Has more than sufficient suction.,7
738,I reused a wide and narrow nossel accessory.,0
739,It only comes with a single narrow attachment.,0
740,"Only downside, excellent otherwise",5

0,I have owned this TV for about 10 months,5
1,and am currently looking to replace it.,5
2,The sound is TERRIBLE.,8
3,Even though the volume goes to 100.,8
4,The actual sounds tops out around 25,8
5,(the rest is for show).,5
6,"I tried hooking up external speakers,",8
7,but it just amplifies the static & makes the problem worse.,8
8,The picture quality is also very rapidly decreasing,4
9,(fuzzy).,4
10,Also DISH Networks universal remote is NOT compatible with this set.,3
11,So plan on keeping 2,5
12,around if using DISH.,5
13,Finally...,5
14,Check out MAGNAVOX's own website.,2
15,They don't even offer support for this TV.,2
16,Should say something about the quality.,5
17,"If you're lookng for an inexpensive HDTV,",6
18,stay away from this one.,6
19,Spend the extra money,5
20,and get a good TV.,5
21,The sound on this is horrendous.,8
22,I have a 10 year old CRT television with much better sound than this.,8
23,Don't even bother with the stereo sound,8
24,because it drowns out all the voices in movies.,8
25,I've had this set for a few years,5
26,and have had only one major problem with it.,5
27,That problem is with the magnitude of the volume.,8
28,"The sound quality isn't so great, either,",8
29,but sometimes the volume is so low,8
30,"that you can barely hear it,",8
31,even if the volume is turned all the way up.,8
32,"To be fair,",5
33,part of the problem is with my cable service,5
34,"(at & t ; Uverse),",5
35,which uses STB boxes,5
36,that emit lower sound levels than others,5
37,I 've,5
38,used in the past,5
39,(mainly Comcast).,5
40,"However,",5
41,"it's always had this problem, regardless of the STB box used,",5
42,and I don't have this problem with STB's connected to other televisions.,5
43,"It's really disappointing,",5
44,"because otherwise, this would be a nice, little television.",5
45,I've even,5
46,tried hooking it up,5
47,"using different connections,",5
48,but the problem persists.,5
49,"Because of this problem, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",5
50,"I can't speak for its longevity,",5
51,"because it is a recent purchase,",5
52,but I found this tv on sale for under $ 200,6
53,and it is exactly what I wanted for our second tv in the bedroom.,5
54,Picture and sound are both acceptable,8
55,when hooked up straight to a cable line,1
56,without digital or HD cable.,5
57,I refuse to pay for HD,5
58,when all I plan to watch,5
59,is the news and Leno!,5
60,Set up was extremely easy and the remote is simple to use.,3
61,Simply plug it in,3
62,and tune to a channel.,3
63,It gets 4 stars,5
64,"because I don't think its worth the price offered here,",6
65,but for what I paid its perfect.,6
66,I bought one of these last Summer,5
67,to watch,5
68,while running on my treadmill.,5
69,It's great for casual TV watching.,5
70,I doubt,5
71,"it's the best LCD TV out there,",5
72,but I can find nothing offensive about it,5
73,and I can watch it for hours.,5
74,Typicially I run the sound through my stereo system,8
75,"and avoid the use of the speakers altogether,",8
76,which as others have pointed out are weak.,8
77,The surprise came,5
78,when my eight year old computer monitor became unuseable,1
79,and I was able to use this little TV for a computer monitor on a temporary basis.,1
80,"It is a better computer monitor, in my opinion,",5
81,than many 15 '' built for the purpose LCD computer monitors.,5
82,I was able to use it for telecommuting all day for several days.,5
83,"So, for a good if not great TV and a rather nice backup computer monitor, this to me is a good deal at the price.",6
84,"But, do yourself a favor and if at all possible buy a multi-year service contract.",5
85,I wish more people waited 6 months to review.,5
86,We bought this TV last fall,5
87,and we loved it.,5
88,"Great price, good picture, easy to install with Netflix.",4
89,We had read about some Toshiba power problems,5
90,and wondered,5
91,if that would be us.,5
92,"Well, guess what?",5
93,It started to shut off on its own in May.,3
94,Then it wouldn't shut off.,3
95,Then it started shutting on and off repeatedly over and over.,3
96,It gets progressively worse with time.,5
97,We can do nothing with it at this point.,5
98,I'm pretty sure,5
99,Toshiba is going to do to me,2
100,what it seems to do to everyone,2
101,who calls -,2
102,they act,2
103,like they 've,2
104,"never heard of it,",2
105,even though there are forums,5
106,everywhere mentioning this issue -,5
107,including Toshiba's own forum.,5
108,"Got a great price,",6
109,but can't do this once a year.,5
110,Better to spend $ 600 on a better brand,5
111,than to throw $ 300 a year at this one.,5
112,Just got the TV.,5
113,Picture and sound are nice.,8
114,Its in a bedroom sized family room.,5
115,There is a slight hum from the TV,8
116,(I double checked with everything else off).,5
117,At low volumes its more noticible.,8
118,Its a common problem just do a search,5
119,on humming for the model.,8
120,If you turn backlight all the way down it gets better.,8
121,"Also, I did notice",5
122,while watching an action movie,5
123,(Swordfish),5
124,the sound did not always keep up.,8
125,Its a very slight gap in sound almost like,8
126,when they just delete a bad word out,5
127,and dont replace it with anything else,5
128,(not the case on this movie).,5
129,It happened a couple of times,5
130,and I dont have a high definition cable box yet.,5
131,It may not happen,5
132,if i use a HDMI cable?,5
133,Its a decent TV for the money but the hum is an issue.,5
134,Picture is great...,4
135,But...,5
136,when I turn up the bass the body of the TV,8
137,vibrates.,8
138,It vibrates to the point of I,8
139,had to turn off the TV speakers,8
140,and use external sound system.,8
141,If you're buying this unit online do,5
142,n't throw the box away!,5
143,You may need to ship it back.,5
144,I returned my first unit back to the store,5
145,to exchange my TV,5
146,and saw four other open box units.,5
147,I'm just putting two and two together.,5
148,This is a great tv.,5
149,Sound and picture quality are very satisfactory.,8
150,"You have different sound and picture settings for different purposes,",8
151,"gaming, movie, sports etc..",5
152,"Since the frame is also black,",7
153,it seems larger than 32 '' at first sight :D.,7
154,There is only one problem,5
155,which is rare.,5
156,When you try to switch the input,1
157,"(from HDMI to cable etc.),",5
158,the screen goes black.,1
159,In that case you should shut down the TV,5
160,and then turn it on.,5
161,That 's,5
162,why I gave 4 stars.,5
163,"Otherwise, it is great.",5
164,We have been,5
165,using it for 7 months,5
166,and we are very happy.,5
167,This is our first experience with an HDTV.,5
168,"So far, so good.",5
169,THe picture is good quality.,4
170,We were surprised to find,5
171,"that even movies made decades ago,",5
172,look much better on HDTV.,5
173,There were a lot of menus and setups,3
174,involved when we first got it.,3
175,That was a little daunting.,3
176,"Overall, we're very happy with the television.",5
177,DO NOT BUY! this SONY Bravia ` Smart ' TV...,5
178,it is a piece of JUNK!,5
179,I have never had to return a purchase before but this time...,5
180,I did the very next day!,5
181,The paper Manual and,5
182,(built in),5
183,"iManual are crap,",5
184,"the Yahoo! widgets do not work,",0
185,the wireless connectivity is 802. 11b...,1
186,which is TOO SLOW to stream HD video...,1
187,: This is supposed to be an HD TV right?,5
188,"Oh, also my TV started emitting a Very High Pitched Scream...",8
189,which in my bedroom is NOT a good thing!,8
190,The software and apps built into this TV,0
191,are difficult to use and setup,0
192,(` difficult ' is,0
193,being generous because I usuallly like the design and attention to detail of Sony products).,0
194,This piece of Junk costs $ 650,6
195,although that won't last very long...,5
196,I notice,5
197,Amazon has a ton of these ` used ' for sale for $ 500...,6
198,DO NOT BUY!,5
199,"Picture quality great,",4
200,"picture not affected by sunlight, picture angle great ; sound not good without supplimentary speakers ; not enough sound and audio inputs and outputs ; Internet streaming",8
201,"is constantly buffering, all except Netflix, Did they even test this TV",1
202,before putting it on the street?,5
203,I'll have to buy a Roku for this TV.,5
204,I NEVER get buffering,1
205,when using Roku! ;,1
206,"I saw a great review for this model on CNET,",5
207,no longer a trusted source ;,5
208,"I can change channels for cable and airway channels on the supplied remote, but not satelite?,",3
209,I will now have three remotes for this TV,3
210,including Roku!,3
211,No longer a Sony fan. : (,5
212,A nice quality TV in the usual Sony tradition.,5
213,Plenty of ports and settings,1
214,to satisfy most everyone.,1
215,Easy hookups to audio and satellite sources.,1
216,However... many people like,5
217,"myself bought it for the internet, Skype and web content",1
218,which are pathetic.,1
219,I have both wired and wireless access,1
220,"and Skype is essentially worthless - slow to load, buggy and poor picture quality",1
221,when it does actually get a connection.,1
222,Web content is equally bad,1
223,and the choices are minimal.,1
224,Get a Roku or Netflix box,0
225,and avoid the Sony apps at all costs.,0
226,The `` Econ '' mode and presence sensor are annoying,5
227,and were immediately turned off.,5
228,This TV looks very good,7
229,and the price is even better.,6
230,The built in WiFi makes it even better,1
231,if you were going to have to purchase the adapter.,5
232,The on-screen menu/options is quite nice,0
233,and the internet apps work as expected.,0
234,I especially enjoy the Pandora app.,0
235,I'll post back later,5
236,if I have any issues with the TV.,5
237,The TV in my office finally died,5
238,so the time came to get a new one.,5
239,I researched several products,5
240,and landed on this Sony,5
241,and boy am I glad,5
242,I did.,5
243,From the moment I took it out of the Box I was both surprised and impressed.,5
244,The stand,7
245,it came,7
246,with has a swivel base and the form factor,7
247,was even thinner,7
248,than I expected.,7
249,Then I turned it on...,5
250,The picture is clear and sharp.,4
251,The sound is clear as well.,8
252,It is WiFi enabled,1
253,which was a,1
254,must have for me,1
255,but boy did I under estimate,5
256,what I was getting with that.,5
257,Let's just say,5
258,there is a dedicated button on the remote,0
259,"for accessing Netflix,",0
260,how cool is that.,5
261,I just do not have enough time,5
262,to list all of the amazing features in this review.,5
263,But the numbers of options available in the on-line area of the Tv are numerous and extremely useful!,0
264,"In summary, this is fantastic TV",5
265,and was one of my best electronics purchases to date!,5
266,Set functioned well for a few months,5
267,and suddenly was unresponsive to the remote.,3
268,"After a lot of fiddling, we got the remote",3
269,to do everything,3
270,but turn it on and off.,3
271,Now we have to do that manually and sometimes we can get NO SOUND.,8
272,"Trouble started after 13 months,",5
273,"but we were away for 2-1/2 months,",5
274,so the failure happened after just 10-1/2 months of use.,5
275,"Of course, that",5
276,screwed us for the warranty.,5
277,"Now shopping for a replacement,",5
278,but NOT A PANASONIC!,5
279,I don't use the speakers on this TV.,5
280,"In fact,",5
281,"because the only audio out is optical fiber,",1
282,I have to connect my rca cables to the DVR.,1
283,And,5
284,"if I want to watch DVD/blu-ray,",1
285,I have to switch the cables.,1
286,This is a very bad design for a low end TV ;,1
287,to require high-end audio connection.,1
288,And,5
289,"if I were to use the TV's speakers,",8
290,I would probably have shot out the TV by now.,8
291,They are that bad.,8
292,"Tinny and grating, I got better sound from a transistor radio from the 1960 's.",8
293,"Adjusting bass, treble, etc on this is annoying and only moderately helpful.",8
294,But the video quality is good,4
295,and I have no complaints about that.,4
296,The form factor is also very good.,5
297,I love,5
298,how shallow,5
299,(thin),5
300,"the profile is,",7
301,"and the bezel is thin, as well.",7
302,I also give it kudos for the energy efficiency.,5
303,I have been a loyal Panasonic owner for years,5
304,(currently have six Panasonic TVs,5
305,and have recommended them to many others).,5
306,"HOWEVER, this unit is a great disappointment.",5
307,The picture is not at all crisp,4
308,(hooked up to a Direct TV HD receiver),1
309,and the audio is TERRIBLE!!!,8
310,"Fortunately, with my Direct TV receiver, I can pass the audio directly to my audio system.",5
311,"If I did not have this option,",5
312,I would have returned the unit.,5
313,"Note,",5
314,"this TV does not come with an analog audio out, only digital,",5
315,so your output options are limited,5
316,if you want to listen thru alternative speakers.,8
317,Panasonic completely missed the boat with this unit.,5
318,What a shame!!,5
319,"Repalced my 27 "" JVC clunker with this one.",5
320,It fit perfectly inside our armoir.,5
321,"Good picture, easy to set up and program.",4
322,"Decent sound, not great...",8
323,"We have the 42 "" version of this set as a Plasma downstairs.",5
324,Also a solid set.,5
325,Great Tv for the price.,6
326,Easy to setup.,3
327,"The picture is just as good as on my panasonic viera 42 "" plasma tv.",4
328,The audio is ok for the tiny speakers.,8
329,Good for my bedroom.,5
330,"Much better than the 20 "" tube tv.",5
331,The picture was obviously great,4
332,but there was a huge buzz directly in front of the screen,8
333,where I sit about 12-15 feet away.,8
334,The buzz would overpower any low volume scenes,8
335,in whatever I was watching.,8
336,I spoke to Samsung 3 times and,2
337,"while they were very nice and tried to be helpful,",2
338,their suggestions did not work,2
339,"(tried lowering brightness, contrast, and plug directly into the wall).",5
340,"If you moved away from the center of the TV by even a few feet,",5
341,the buzz would disappear,8
342,but I'm not going to watch my new expensive TV from a slight angle.,5
343,Don't know,5
344,if I just had a bad TV or all Samsung plasmas are like this,5
345,but I didn't want to take a chance,5
346,so I returned this TV after 2 days,5
347,and have gone with a LED TV.,5
348,Perfectly quiet now.,5
349,"I had heard about plasmas and their buzzing issues,",5
350,but since my previous plasma,5
351,(Panasonic),5
352,"made no noticeable noise at viewing distance,",5
353,I went ahead,5
354,and purchased this Samsung.,5
355,First impressions were positive.,5
356,"It has an excellent picture,",4
357,although the automatic brightness adjustment feature is somewhat annoying and can be turned off.,4
358,It wasn't until I sat on my couch,5
359,and started watching a show,5
360,that I started to notice an buzzing sound in my ear.,8
361,"I checked all my connections, no change.",8
362,This wasn't a quiet hum either.,8
363,At first I thought,5
364,it was something,5
365,"I would get used to,",5
366,but alas I just couldn't bear it,5
367,so I returned the TV.,5
368,Maybe mine was faulty,5
369,but I'm not,5
370,risking replacing it with another Samsung.,5
371,The set has fantastic resolution,4
372,and the price compares very favorably with comparable products.,6
373,The customer service representatives are very courteous but perhaps not as knowledgeable of the product,2
374,as they could be.,2
375,I had to contact the audio device manufacturer,2
376,"to learn how to possibly accomodate the "" TV Ears "" product.",2
377,This TV does not offer an audio out with standard RCA.,8
378,DAC,8
379,(digital audio converter),8
380,was added but unsuccessful,8
381,when following instructions from Samsung rep,8
382,to set to PMA in audio.,8
383,The signal through the cable receiver will function with the TV Ears apparatus,1
384,but we continue to be unable to receive broadband through the hearing assistance device.. A standard audio out would be a welcome addition to this productThe clicking sound,8
385,when adjusting volume distorts programming,8
386,until the adjustment is completed.,8
387,"That is annoying and unnecessary,",8
388,I think.,5
389,I called customer service,2
390,and was told there is no setting change,8
391,which will eliminate the click.,8
392,Don't order this,5
393,if your room is brightly lit.,5
394,The screen is highly reflective.,4
395,"Great picture, amazing sound, Wi-Fi is easy to set up",8
396,"(you need to hard wire temporarily to your router/modem to do it though),",1
397,"and many other really neat features to keep you occupied for hours, days and maybe longer!",5
398,Very happy with my purchase.,5
399,Better than the Panasonic it replaced.,5
400,Vibrant colors.,4
401,Brightness adjusts automatically.,4
402,Fast response to remote commands.,3
403,Smart TV with lots of Apps.,0
404,I prefer wired Network,1
405,because it is more reliable than the built in WiFi.,1
406,No problems whatsoever.,5
407,I would buy it again.,5
408,I am Tech Savvy,5
409,and this Samsung TV is an excellent choice.,5
410,I bought this tv for a bedroom.,5
411,I wanted it to be able to pick up over-the-air stations with an antenna,5
412,if the cable went down.,5
413,"I placed the tv on a nightstand under a window,",1
414,"hooked up the antenna,",5
415,and attempted to scan for channels.,1
416,"After 3 attempts, it was unable to recognize any channels at all!",1
417,An older 10 '' picture tube,5
418,Sony tv from the 90's in the same location with the same antenna,5
419,can and still does pick up over 30 stations,5
420,(with the help of an Insignia digital converter box).,5
421,"When I unhooked the antenna from the Apex tv,",5
422,the cable input jack snapped off the tv!,5
423,The cable input jack is the achilles heel of this tv.,5
424,The design of the tv in the back prevents a straight hookup of a cable wire or antenna,1
425,without it being kinked.,1
426,Think twice,5
427,before buying this tv :,5
428,"the price is enticing,",6
429,but beware of the design flaw of the input connections.,1
430,The picture quality is very sharp & crisp,4
431,although the sound is horribley `` tinny '' & squeaky.,8
432,"Like a previous reviewer, I also had to go out",5
433,"and get new, external speakers -- around $ 20 at Staples.",5
434,"These made a world of sound difference,",8
435,but it was a hassle,5
436,that I really didn't need.,5
437,Steve B.,5
438,The TV is great except the sound.,8
439,The sound seems to come from the back,8
440,and it is very,8
441,(tunnel),8
442,like.,8
443,You have to really put on the bass,8
444,to get a decent sound.,8
445,The picture is great.,4
446,I was looking for a larger TV for this small room.,5
447,I had a dvd player and screen in use for years there.,5
448,So,5
449,when I got this one,5
450,it was perfect!,5
451,The sound is not bad.,8
452,Great view from the side.,4
453,"Not so much under or above it,",4
454,but who does that?,5
455,"(oh, I did...",5
456,lol),5
457,Anywho.,5
458,It's worth the price.,6
459,Great delivery.,5
460,No complaints. respect,5
461,I love this TV.,5
462,"The picture is glorious,",4
463,as if you are,5
464,looking through a window.,5
465,"It is light, slim, and sleek.",7
466,The ports are good.,1
467,The only two downsides of this TV is the sound and the cable connector.,8
468,The cable connection port,1
469,(or whatever,5
470,it's called),5
471,is very tight.,1
472,Took a while for me to screw in the wire.,5
473,The other downside is the sound.,8
474,The sound from the TV itself is very tiny.,8
475,"I had to purchase computer speakers for it,",5
476,but now I am totally satisfied.,5
477,"This is a nice affordable TV,",6
478,that is perfect for a bedroom.,5
479,Very pleased!!!,5
480,We have to watch the TV with the Volume all the way to 64,8
481,and it sounds the same,8
482,as ti does at level 35.,8
483,The remote doesn't work very well either.,3
484,I would NOT recommend this TV to anyone!,5
485,This TV has been one big disappointment.,5
486,The picture looks very pixelated,4
487,when playing bluray movies through my HDMI cable,4
488,which i have tested on another TV.,5
489,When using it as a monitor,5
490,using the VGA cable the picture has some fussiness to it,4
491,and i can see lines across the screen.,4
492,I sent it back,5
493,and got,5
494,a replacement,5
495,thinking maybe i,5
496,"got a defective one,",5
497,but the 2nd one had the same issues plus a stuck pixel that i couldnt fix.,4
498,I will be returning this one today,5
499,and will be looking for a better brand,5
500,that will be a little more expensive.,5
501,I would not recommend this TV to anyone,4
502,who cares about picture quality.,4
503,"Easy to set up,",3
504,"picture is good,",4
505,but sound quality is very poor.,8
506,"There are setting for sound,",8
507,"which helped at little,",8
508,but it stills sounds,8
509,like you are in a tunnel.,8
510,"A home theater sound system might be the answer to this concern,",5
511,but I have not tried that option yet.,5
512,The first TV,5
513,I received was defective.,5
514,"Although the picture was good,",4
515,there were so many stuck pixels,4
516,they became a distraction.,4
517,"With this replacement monitor, I decided to set it up",5
518,as a PC monitor,5
519,since my Dell was getting old,5
520,and was much smaller.,5
521,I'm really enjoying this unit.,5
522,"It was very easy to set up to the PC,",3
523,"and I was pleased with the bright, clear color.",4
524,The best thing about it is the size.,7
525,"I do not see well,",5
526,and I am,5
527,thrilled with how easy it is to see things on this monitor.,5
528,"I do lots of editing,",5
529,and this is definitely going to make my life easier.,5
530,"Fortunately, it just fit on my desk",5
531,and perfectly matches my black PC and printer.,7
532,I highly recommend it to those of you,5
533,who have decreased eyesight.,5
534,You will love it,5
535,and will never want to work with a small monitor again.,5
536,No issues with the Coby TFTV3247 32 inch 1080p 120Hz Widescreen LCD HDTV.,5
537,"Shipped to me in Afghanistan at an APO address,",5
538,"arrived in great shape,",5
539,packaged carefully.,5
540,"Picture is awesome, zero lag for gaming, plenty of inputs on the back.",1
541,I didn't see any of the old A/V inputs,1
542,(the Red White and Yellow ones) however.,1
543,"For the price, you won't do any better than this.",6
544,I've had it for a little over a month now.,5
545,The sound is mediocre.,8
546,"When the picture is blank,",4
547,the right side of the screen is blue,5
548,while the left side is black.,5
549,"This blue "" tint "" is also visible",4
550,when viewing programming.,4
551,"While the price was attractive,",6
552,I would not repeat this purchase.,5
553,This tv has great picture and sound...,8
554,however the screen is messed up like some others,4
555,reviewers have mentioned.,5
556,"Large White or faded spots on the screen,",4
557,which you usually can not see,4
558,"when the picture is colorful and bright,",4
559,"but any dark scenes the foggy, white, large area is quite noticeable.",4
560,Very frustrating.,5
561,This is not acceptable for purchasing a new tv,5
562,as I see it as an investment.,5
563,You want the quality to be as new and the product,5
564,to last.,5
565,I paid for an extended warranty,5
566,and why do,5
567,that if the product is faulty from the get go.,5
568,Disappointed,5
569,"For the price, I'm happy with this",6
570,(about $ 300 delivered to my door with Prime).,6
571,"However, the sound is lacking.",8
572,It definitely needs to be fed through a sound system for good movie watching.,8
573,"Also,",5
574,"once you turn it on,",5
575,it takes so long for the screen,5
576,to light up,5
577,that you might turn it off thinking,5
578,you didn't push the button hard enough the first time.,5
579,"With that said,",5
580,"I'm very happy with the picture and the placement of inputs,",4
581,etc. is all good.,5
582,This was our first flat screen Tv purchase.,5
583,We are very pleased.,5
584,The picture is great,4
585,and it has all the features and inputs,5
586,we need.,5
587,Only negative is the sound.,8
588,Has the tinny sound of small speakers.,8
589,Plan to get a sound bar,5
590,to remedy the situation.,5
591,Looking to buy another,5
592,if the price is right.,5
593,"Easy to set up, nice slim lines, great picture and sound.",8
594,I have a 47 inch vizio,4
595,and the picture is as good if not better than that tv.,4
596,It is everything,5
597,I could have asked for.,5
598,I've had this one,5
599,replaced already,5
600,once because it starts to get spots after about 6 months.,4
601,The replacement TV did the exact same thing.,4
602,Now that I'm beyond warranty I'm stuck with it,5
603,as the spots get bigger and bigger every day.,4
604,"I used to love the TV,",5
605,now it just reminds me,5
606,when I look at it,5
607,how much I got ripped off.,6
608,"Check any display units in the store,",5
609,they might have the problem.,5
610,It only shows,4
611,when the TV projects white colors.,4
612,A hockey game is the most obvious way,5
613,to show them.,5
614,Very poor picture.,4
615,I bought this at costco for $ 1450.,6
616,"At home I did a side to side comparison to my 55 "" full array Sony.",5
617,The vizio picture was quite poor in comparison.,4
618,Very grainy and lousy motion control.,4
619,I think,5
620,I will wait for the Vizio P series,5
621,and see how that looks.,5
622,I will start off,5
623,by saying,5
624,this tv completely fails as a smart tv.,0
625,It comes preloaded with netflix,0
626,which would be great except for it lacks the processor speed necessary to actually stream anything.,0
627,Lacks a net browser and the only thing,0
628,that I hsve found to work well,0
629,is pandora.,0
630,Fortunately this is not,5
631,why I bought the tv.,5
632,I got it because of the picture size and price.,4
633,The picture is a good quality,4
634,and has very little lag watching sports.,4
635,Good quality and picture but the sports programs,4
636,I have watched get a little choppy.,4
637,All in all I am quite happy for the price.,6
638,It's funny,5
639,"how a massive 70 "" tv seemed giant",7
640,when I got it.,7
641,Now it seems like a normal size,7
642,"and I want an 85 ""!",7
643,Can't go wrong for a 70 inch led tv for less than $ 1600.,7
644,The quality of the picture is amazing,4
645,after applying some calibration settings.,4
646,Colors really pop,4
647,and blacks are decent for an edge lit led.,4
648,Don't really notice any motion blur even with soap opera effect,4
649,turned off.,4
650,I sit about 9 feet away,5
651,and it's perfect.,5
652,Not to big not to small.,7
653,Delivery guys did,2
654,an awesome job bring it in the family room,2
655,and putting it on the stand.,2
656,I highly recommend this tv to anyone,5
657,looking for quality at a great price.,6
658,"When I bought this TV,",5
659,I was looking for a solid 58 ' 120HZ TV,5
660,without 3D or smart capabilities.,5
661,I read the reviews,5
662,and I thought,5
663,this would be the perfect fit.,5
664,I was so wrong.,5
665,Spend the extra couple hundred,5
666,and buy a TV from a well respected company.,5
667,Below is the list of my Buyer Beware remarks :,5
668,The picture quality was worse than my 5 year old LCD Samsung.,4
669,The TV is not true 120hz.,4
670,It is the 60hz awkward enhanced magic.,4
671,Fast moving objects were incredibly pixelated and blotchy.,4
672,It was very disappointing.,5
673,The TV died exactly 2 months after purchase.,5
674,The TV would power on to a black screen.,5
675,Sending it back to Amazon incurred a 20 % restocking fee.,2
676,"After returning this TV to amazon,",5
677,I went,5
678,and bought a LG TV.,5
679,I could not be happier with the new TV,5
680,and wish,5
681,I would not have been such a cheap skate a few months ago.,5
682,"It was great for the first 6 months then all of a sudden it wont turn on,",5
683,Ive tried different outlets and nothing.,5
684,Customer service is non,2
685,existent I was on hold over an hour,2
686,"and finally hung up,",2
687,TWICE!!,2
688,Ive tried them on line,2
689,and the page gets an error message every time.,2
690,It looks good for the price but its really not worth it.,6
691,SKIP THIS TRASH!!,5
692,The TCL TV is an odd mix.,5
693,The sound is,8
694,surprisingly very good and for general TV viewing,8
695,does not need a sound bar.,8
696,The sound is better,8
697,than TV's twice its price.,8
698,The picture however was very disappointing.,4
699,I struggled,5
700,for 4 days,5
701,trying to get this TV,5
702,is look good.,5
703,I found,5
704,that it was inconsistent. 720p cable TV looked,4
705,washed out but 720p movies,4
706,that I had ripped looked okay.,4
707,"Blacks were okay,",4
708,but bright colors generally looked,4
709,"posterized and the "" blocks "" during up conversion were pretty obvious.",4
710,Funnily enough the 120hz was great watching a BPL football game.,4
711,My conclusion after fighting settings was that the TV would be great for sports games and watching my own movies,5
712,"(I can control frame rate etc),",5
713,but for cable TV not so good.,5
714,Another issue,5
715,I had,5
716,was a loose frame around the LED,5
717,which led to the light,5
718,bled around the right edge.,5
719,I sent the TV back.,5
720,Great value for $ 499 but not for me.,6
721,I purchased the 46-inch 60Hz version of this LED several months ago for our bedroom,5
722,and we loved it...,5
723,especially for the price.,6
724,"Well,",5
725,it was time for the living room,5
726,to get an upgrade,5
727,and I went directly for the largest TCL LED I could get,5
728,and this one is it.,5
729,"So far, it's a terrific TV.",5
730,"Good picture,",4
731,although we don't have anything,5
732,that can make use of the 120Hz refresh as TV and other media,5
733,go through a Microsoft Windows Media Center HTPC.,5
734,It's an absolute `` no-frills '' TV.,5
735,No `` smart '' capabilities at all and I didn't want them,0
736,as I have no use for them.,5
737,"Our HTPC, Roku, XBox, and Wii provide all of that for us, and more.",5
738,"If you don't need all the features,",0
739,"but want the size,",7
740,this TV is a great deal.,5
741,Keep an eye on the price though... it fluctuates A LOT.,6
742,You can get it at a really good price,6
743,if you're patient,5
744,or aren't in a hurry.,5
745,Love this TV!,5
746,No major issues at all.,5
747,"Video is great,",4
748,sound is great.,8
749,"For the video, I had to use one of the settings.",4
750,I saw,5
751,people take off a star or two for for that fact.,5
752,Who takes off a star,5
753,because the default settings aren't to their personal preference?,5
754,The only issue I encounter is an odd one.,5
755,"Sometimes, after changing TV inputs, the screen goes black after a minute or so.",4
756,"I press the input button again,",4
757,screen goes back to normal.,4
758,Not a huge deal.,5
759,"Other than that, I strongly recommend this product.",5
760,The stand,5
761,"it comes with is pretty flimsy, but as long",5
762,"as it is on a proper TV stand,",5
763,it's no issue.,5

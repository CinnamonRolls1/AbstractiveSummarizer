,sentence,aspect
0,Not meant for the HDTV / LCD times.,5
1,"After 45 min. the RF IN stopped working,",1
2,so Magnavox needs me to MAIL in the TV for replacement.,2
3,This is the worst attempt of HDTV,5
4,I ever seen.,5
5,It is like a no name brand,5
6,that should be blank.,5
7,I would not buy a Magnavox anything,5
8,Digital Video display again.,5
9,Everyday the set looks,5
10,as if it ages 1 year,5
11,"and if it last longer,",5
12,that would be the only good thing to say.,5
13,The TV sounds,8
14,as if lightning is going through the speakers,8
15,and is as bad as the display,8
16,which looks like lightning struck it.,4
17,No way will you ever get a picture,5
18,that looks like Magnavox 15MF605T 15 '' LCD Flat Panel TV image on the web page.,5
19,Cable picture is poor.,4
20,Sound is terrible.,8
21,"Despite matching its progressive scan capabilities with a progressive scan DVD player,",5
22,it DID NOT meet George Lucas ' picture specifications,5
23,(which can be accomplished by tube-televisions over 10 years old).,5
24,Too bad,5
25,Sony has,5
26,discontinued making anything under 20 ''. Bottom line is -,5
27,if you have an eye and ear for detail - do not buy this TV.,8
28,The color and definition are excellent.,4
29,We wanted a small TV for our kitchen counter...,5
30,"and it fit the bill,",5
31,it seemed.,5
32,Not so fast...,5
33,it's loudest volume has us straining to hear.,8
34,"The good thing is we are a bit quieter at dinner,",8
35,or we can't hear the TV.,8
36,"However, I am told,",5
37,"If I have the room for unsightly wires,",5
38,I can add speakers to help this situation disappear...,5
39,"but, why would I want to clutter the area with more stuff?",5
40,"So,",5
41,"it would be best to buy this TV for a bedroom or child's room, and not a busy area...",5
42,or you'll be doing a lot of shushing!,5
43,"I had to take the first one back... fuzzy fonts, ghosting, and one dead pixel.",4
44,So I took it back to the retailer,5
45,"where I got a GREAT deal on this TV,",5
46,and the second unit,5
47,"I tried worked perfectly with a much improved picture, expecially on the XBox.",4
48,I bought this for my son for Christmas,5
49,so I'm glad to know,5
50,it doubles,5
51,as a computer monitor with a built in VGA port.,1
52,That'll save some money.,5
53,"Nice and bright with good colors, I like it.",4
54,"BTW, the retailer",5
55,I returned the first unit too,5
56,commented,5
57,they had taken `` a lot '' of these back today.,5
58,"Not worth $ 300,",6
59,but if you can find it for a steal...,5
60,I've had this TV,5
61,Since 2005,5
62,and I bought it for my bedroom.,5
63,It's been,5
64,when they first started coming out,5
65,and it was all,5
66,I could afford at the time,5
67,but it has been a great tv no complaints.,5
68,When I watch tv in bed,5
69,and my hubby needs to sleep I change the picture,4
70,setting so its not too bright cause there,4
71,is so many different settings.,3
72,I live this TV.,5
73,But it's time,5
74,to get a bigger tv,5
75,and sell this one.,5
76,It has been nothing but great to me!!!,5
77,One of the best tv 's!!!,5
78,"Like so many other reviews, I too have the same issue after a few years of use.",5
79,The set shuts off,3
80,and then cycles on and off with any HD input signal.,1
81,I can only watch standard channels from my cable box,1
82,and can't watch movies at all from my computer.,1
83,Toshiba knows,5
84,they produced a lemon,5
85,but will do nothing about it.,5
86,They have lost my business forever.,5
87,A television should last much longer than 3 years!!!!,5
88,"Purchased 10mo ago in 8/2009, and as soon",5
89,as warranty has expired i started,5
90,having issues.,5
91,Of course Toshiba would not speak to me,2
92,unless i paid for technician,2
93,to come over,2
94,and fix it.,2
95,I won't buy any Toshiba products anymore.,5
96,Not reliable.,5
97,I've had this tv for about a month now.,5
98,"Overall, it's an ok tv.",5
99,My biggest issue with the image quality.,4
100,I've fiddled with the preferences a bit,5
101,but still can't fix the problem.,5
102,"The overall colors are alright,",4
103,black levels are good.,4
104,BUT - there is a noticeable and irritating `` trace '' effect with the color red.,4
105,"Especially if a person has really red lips, as their head moves,",5
106,there's a trace of red,4
107,that follows.,5
108,Same affect with quick body movement.,4
109,I have over the air tv,5
110,"(which I understand,",5
111,is part of the problem),5
112,-,5
113,so even programs,4
114,that are broadcast in HD,4
115,still have traces.,4
116,"And I still have this problem with DVDs and video games,",4
117,even when I use higher end connections,1
118,(like the hdmi).,1
119,Is there a certain setting,5
120,I should have?,5
121,Or this a problem with the tv?,5
122,"If it is,",5
123,I am very disappointed in the quality of this tv.,5
124,"There are some great reviews already in place on this TV,",5
125,so I'll keep it simple.,5
126,I managed to purchase this TV for 340,6
127,when I caught it on sale just before black friday,5
128,(thanks Amazon!).,5
129,And for the money I don't think,5
130,I could have asked for more!,5
131,"There are a few presets in place already for picture settings,",5
132,but I recommend using the one,5
133,that's supplied in one of the reviews here.,5
134,Beautiful colors and crisp quality of images in this TV.,4
135,Has 2 HDMI slots in the back as well as 2 component and 2 A/V and S-Video.,1
136,One of my absolute favorite features is,3
137,that each input can have its own customized picture settings!!!,3
138,So no worries about having to reset them,5
139,each time you use them.,5
140,The only thing about this TV lacking is the sound options.,8
141,You really don't have any sort of settings to change or improve,8
142,"and the overall sound is fairly good, but nothing amazing.",8
143,A sound bar or surround sound system will be needed to give you the true HD viewing experience,8
144,one would want.,5
145,That 's,5
146,why I give this gem of a TV a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars.,5
147,But,5
148,if you're not a sound junkie or don't mind buying a sound bar,8
149,then you've found,5
150,what I believe to be the best 32 '',5
151,720p TV under 400 dollars!!!,6
152,This is my first HDTV,5
153,"that I have bought,",5
154,"simply put, gorgeous!!",5
155,The picture on this tv is super crisp.,4
156,"The blacks are incredible,",4
157,my only complaint,8
158,which is minor,5
159,"is the sound,",8
160,the sound is great,8
161,but there is a bit of vibration,8
162,when it's set too loud.,8
163,I have noticed no ghosting at all!,5
164,which is surprising for a 60hz LCD.,5
165,"Perfect for any type of gaming, Forza 3, MW2, Mass effect 2.",5
166,"All in all for the price, this baby is great!",6
167,I am very disappointed with this TV for two reasons : picture brightness and channel menu.,4
168,The picture looked dull and not bright at all even compared to my 6-year old Sony LCD TV.,4
169,This issue was seen on both cable channels and DVD.,4
170,"About the channel menu issue,",3
171,"since I do not own the cable box,",5
172,I had to use the QCAM to scan channel from the cable line directly.,3
173,"Because of this, I had a lot of unwanted channels",3
174,that this TV does not allow me to remove from the channel list.,3
175,Samsung TV does.,5
176,"Because of these two issues, I returned the Sony TV",5
177,and purchase the Samsung UN40D5500.,5
178,The picture looks excellent.,4
179,"However, this Samsung TV does not integrated WI-FI.",1
180,Unit developed a high pitch whine,8
181,and was replaced with a refurbished unit.,2
182,The replacement unit failed within two months.,5
183,Waiting for the second replacement unit.,2
184,I WAS a dedicated Sony customer.,5
185,Their service is handled off shore making communication a bit difficult. : (,2
186,Picture is crisp and clear with lots of options,4
187,to change for personal preferences.,5
188,"However, the streaming speed for netflix is just down right terrible. most of the time I just quit",1
189,watching it,0
190,and use my xbox to watch netflix anymore.,5
191,But other than that not much to really complain about.,5
192,I have owned this television for almost a year,5
193,and have been extremely happy with it.,5
194,"I watch cable, Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube videos and computer movie files on it.",0
195,"What I like best are the many ports - 4 hdmi, 1 component, 1 composite and 1 USB.",1
196,Also you can change the display and sound settings on each port.,8
197,The sound is good and strong.,8
198,The picture is beautiful.,4
199,There have been a couple of problems.,5
200,I have Comcast digital cable,1
201,and it will not work with an HDMI connection because of a conflict with Comcast's DHCP.,1
202,"So, I have the cable",1
203,connected to the component port,1
204,and it does have a nice HD picture.,1
205,"Once in a while lately, the tv turns itself off.",5
206,I don't know,5
207,"what this problem is,",5
208,but 95 % of the time it does not do this.,5
209,So I leave well enough alone.,5
210,Maybe I have an incorrect setting.,5
211,You can connect a USB external hard drive,1
212,"or flash drive to the USB port,",1
213,"and it will play movies, but not. avi files.",1
214,"Also you can play movies from your computer thru the DLNA,",1
215,if you have it enabled on your computer.,1
216,"But again, you can't play. avi files.",1
217,Unbelieveable picture and the setup is so easy.,4
218,We keep saying,5
219,"wow look at the color, look at the sharpness of the picture, amazing.",4
220,"So easy to change sound tracking, cool.",8
221,"Love this TV great size for the bedroom, would go bigger in a livingroom, bigger",7
222,would be better.,7
223,Sound is good much better,8
224,than most TV 's,8
225,but speakers would really help.,8
226,"Took it out of the box, plugged it it, put it back in the box.",5
227,To my way,5
228,of thinking,5
229,"it's not that the sound quality is poor,",8
230,it is,5
231,that the sound quality is not worthy of a shippable product.,8
232,I bought this 24 inch TV for my kitchen wall,5
233,to replace a 10 year old Sanyo set,5
234,and the Sanyo sounds ten times better.,8
235,Who cares,5
236,if the picture is decent,4
237,if the sound is horrible.,8
238,AND there is no way to hook up a set of small powered computer speakers as far as I know.,1
239,The set has an odd RCA like `` Digital Audio Output '',1
240,port,5
241,that the Panasonic tech swears,1
242,is an optical audio output.,1
243,Huh?,5
244,Read the manual guys.,5
245,"Bought this tv elsewhere,",5
246,"but after a year and a few months,",5
247,it went out on me.,5
248,"The power button cuts on,",5
249,"but there is no picture,",4
250,its completely black.,5
251,And,5
252,"when i try to turn it off,",3
253,"it wont cut off,",3
254,"the red power button stays on,",3
255,unless i unplug.,3
256,-- Im not the only person,5
257,who has had this exact problem with the Panasonic Viera tv.,5
258,"Panasonic really needs to check this out,",5
259,& make better tvs.,5
260,Called around & everyone told me,5
261,"I'd have to pay a $ 49 diagnostic fee, + plus 100 +",2
262,to get it fixed.,2
263,If thats the case,5
264,"I might as well buy a new tv,",5
265,they run for $ 199-300.,5
266,I'm not going to buy a new tv every 2 years,5
267,just because they make bad quality tvs.,5
268,If thats the case i,5
269,can go back the fat screens,5
270,that lasted 15 years.,5
271,** ATTENTION Panasonic fix this!,5
272,Til then i'll stick with another brand.,5
273,Needed a small set for my home/office.,5
274,This size was perfect.,7
275,I did read prior reviews on the issues,5
276,if this not being full HD.,4
277,"But,",5
278,for the holiday season,5
279,"lightening deal price it was still to good pass up as this is not my primary TV,",5
280,but perfect for the home/office.,5
281,"By far NOT the best Panny product,",5
282,but rather have this than some off brand no name TV with worse quality,5
283,withing the price range.,6
284,This is a nice TV,5
285,when you want one for a smaller room.,5
286,The picture is great,4
287,and the sound is ok.,8
288,"If you want better sound,",5
289,you can always get a sound bar.,5
290,I am going to be hooking this TV up to my son's playstation soon so,5
291,that he can use it to play video games,5
292,and watch movies.,5
293,I chose this rating by the sheer approval,5
294,my parents gave this TV.,5
295,The quality of the picture is beyond adequate for what they 're,4
296,using it for.,4
297,They have,5
298,placed it in their camper.,5
299,The lighting the screen emits is very vibrant and the colors show up very well.,4
300,Blu-Ray's and DVD's look great.,4
301,The audio is above what i expected from a 24-Inch TV.,8
302,I tested it with First-Person Shooters on the Xbox 360,5
303,and it was topnotch.,5
304,The size of the hardware is slim,7
305,and fits perfectly in their cubbyhole,7
306,they 've,5
307,set it up in.,5
308,It stands sturdy,5
309,and hasn't fallen over,5
310,while they've moved the camper from camp ground to camp ground.,5
311,I'd suggest this TV for anyone,5
312,who wants a solid unit!,5
313,Hope this helps someone out there!,5
314,"Although the TV itself is fine,",5
315,"if you're buying this for the Samsung Smart TV capability,",0
316,do n't!,0
317,"It depends on connecting to the Samsung servers through your internet connection,",1
318,"and on some days, their servers are overwhelmed",1
319,and you can't connect.,1
320,Which means you can't access Hulu or Netflix,1
321,or whatever else you'd like to watch.,1
322,Very frustrating to spend the extra money on this TV and then not have the service be available,6
323,when you'd like to watch something.,6
324,Pros :,5
325,"TV is nice with big screen, good color, great sound & 3D",8
326,which all normal 3D television has...,5
327,Cons :,5
328,It really lacks in smartness,0
329,as we can't watch videos,0
330,(flash files),0
331,from internet & it won't let you to download,1
332,flash/any files to get it done.,1
333,you have to update with new firmware,1
334,but the worst part is Samsung,2
335,don't have a firmware with latest flash & DIVX file support as of today,2
336,(09 July 2012).,5
337,The TV picture is fine.,4
338,The rub is,5
339,the Apps didn't work after the first week.,0
340,My TV is connected to the internet,1
341,but receiving errors like ERROR_EXE_001 & ERROR_MODEL_BIND.,1
342,I can not get onto netflix,0
343,or browse the internet.,1
344,According to some research I have done,5
345,the issue is on Samsungs end with their servers not handling traffic well.,1
346,"I wouldn't suggest buying this TV for the "" Smart "" features.",5
347,It arrived on time to my house undamaged.,2
348,"It was fairly straightforward to setup,",3
349,although you will probably want to have another person help out.,3
350,This thing is huge!,7
351,it doesn't weigh that much for how big it is its just awkward.,7
352,The 3d works fine,5
353,if you are into that.,5
354,"The smart hub is alright,",0
355,some of the apps work better than others.,0
356,"The most important part is the picture quality,",4
357,and that is excellent.,4
358,One thing,5
359,that would be nice is an hdmi out,1
360,it would make having a homet heater setup,1
361,and using the smart hub a little easier.,1
362,"I did not calibrate it yet,",5
363,"but in Movie mode the picture quality is fantastic, deep warm colors, black blacks, sharp details.",4
364,I had friends over,5
365,and every single person was amazed by the picture.,4
366,"The pentile matrix of 60 inch screen doesn't make any difference from my viewing difference of 9 feet,",4
367,but,5
368,if you plan to sit closer to this TV,5
369,"you might be better off with LG or Panasonic. 3D is great,",5
370,however having extra glasses over my prescription glasses is annoying.,5
371,If you can get 65 inch,7
372,without 3D for the same price you,7
373,should consider it.,7
374,But I am also planning to play some 3D games,5
375,so I will keep this set.,5
376,Sound quality is decent,8
377,and it is loud enough,8
378,unless your air conditioner is very noisy.,5
379,"Overall I am more than happy with this TV,",5
380,it looks oh so much better than in the store when at home without extra lights.,7
381,"I was given my TV as a gift,",5
382,it didn't last a year.,5
383,"What a POS, not too mention the "" help desk "" were not helpful at all.",2
384,It's more hassel,5
385,than it's worth.,5
386,Spend a little more money,5
387,and get a decent TV.,5
388,"Yes, the picture is good.",4
389,It's lightweight.,7
390,It would be fine for a guest bedroom,5
391,where it is used only occasionally.,5
392,The sound is so tinny,8
393,-- even after adjusting the bass and treble --,8
394,that I do not recommend it for everyday use.,8
395,This is my 1st flat screen,5
396,and for the price I am satisfied.,6
397,The sound is weird on it...,8
398,"so if you are wanting to jam out to MTV,",5
399,I wouldn't use this.,8
400,But for a small bedroom tv it does,5
401,what I need it to do.,5
402,Again the price was the reason,6
403,I got it.,6
404,The picture is just fine.,4
405,Nice clear color and sharp picture.,4
406,Bought this little TV for my exercise room,5
407,and it really nice for this application.,5
408,Gave it 4 stars because the sound is really kinda `` tinny ''.,8
409,(most of these thin tv's have room for improvement,8
410,with there speakers),8
411,Has a real nice picture,4
412,and seems to work just great.,5
413,I'm happy with it!...,5
414,Penny,5
415,"This is a good secondary TV, one for the guest bedroom or the RV, or for use",5
416,as a computer monitor,5
417,if you don't need a large one.,5
418,"It's very compact and light,",7
419,so you can easily move it from room to room.,7
420,"The picture is not only good,",4
421,it's good from several angles.,4
422,"I like old movies,",5
423,and the black-and-white contrast in this TV is better than the grayed-out one of a 27-inch LED TV,4
424,I recently bought at almost three times the price.,5
425,"As with every TV I've owned in recent years,",5
426,"you can get several picture aspects : 4 : 3 normal, 16 : 9 widescreen, zoom, or cinema.",5
427,"The sound is not great,",8
428,"but it's pretty good,",8
429,and,5
430,(if you want),5
431,you can turn it to quite loud.,8
432,This TV does boot rather slowly,5
433,"(the picture is slow to appear),",5
434,"and changing channels is also slow,",5
435,but I can live with that.,5
436,The remote control has the usual features,3
437,and is easy to interpret.,3
438,"In sum, this is a very nice little TV for an excellent price.",6
439,I received a broken TV.,5
440,It was missing the screw for it's stand,5
441,and it had 3 dead pixels.,4
442,The batteries for the remote were still good.,5
443,That's a plus.,5
444,"Also, the sound on this thing is terrible.",8
445,Worse than the cheapest laptop speakers...,8
446,Not happy with this purchase.,5
447,I bought this,5
448,because I was looking for a new TV for an extra bedroom.,5
449,"A 32 inch LCD 1080 120 Hz for under $ 240. 00,",6
450,said why not.,5
451,"Right out the box, the TV had green color and lines through the screen.",4
452,I was hoping,5
453,it was just a setting but come to find out its a defect,5
454,and had to send it back.,5
455,"Once the new TV came,",5
456,the problem was gone.,5
457,The picture is nice and clear but the sound is horrible.,8
458,I highly recommend having a sound system for this TV.,5
459,The picture is great.,4
460,You can't go wrong with LCD.,5
461,The 32 '' screen is very suitable for your average living room or a bedroom.,7
462,This can also be swapped out for your computer monitor.,1
463,Most people will,5
464,(I expect),5
465,use external sound.,5
466,The built-in speakers really don't sound very good,8
467,-- I think,5
468,"that's par for the course though,",5
469,so it's not a complaint.,5
470,A couple things,5
471,to note :,5
472,start up,5
473,takes about 10 seconds and channel changes take about 4 seconds.,5
474,This unit also puts out some heat in back.,5
475,This unit is quite easy to use,3
476,and to set up.,3
477,This is very affordable for a HDTV.,5
478,We enjoy having this TV.,5
479,Overall a very good tv with great picture quality.,4
480,The sound is the only issue.,8
481,It is not very full with good treble or bass.,8
482,"However,",5
483,when you connect it to a sound system all is well.,5
484,A good value priced tv.,6
485,The TV in my office just died a few days ago.,5
486,"After searching on line and stores,",5
487,I came across this TV.,5
488,It is a great value.,6
489,"The pictures is clear,",4
490,sharp and the colors are vibrant.,4
491,You definitely can't beat the price!,6
492,I highly recommend this TV.,5
493,I received the TV yesterday.,5
494,I expected to have minor issues with back light bleeding,5
495,"as others have reported,",5
496,but it was much worse,5
497,than I expected.,5
498,The bleeding on the right side of screen extended vertically almost entirely from the bottom corner to top corner and then out about 5 inches from right to left along the top and bottom.,4
499,"Also, there was a large blue area in the middle of the screen",5
500,that was very visible,5
501,"when the screen was black,",5
502,and there was a dead pixel in the upper right quadrant of the screen.,4
503,I'd say,5
504,this thing is defective.,5
505,Getting a refund,5
506,and getting something else.,5
507,Quit,5
508,working after 9 + months.,5
509,Worked fine.,5
510,Great Picture.,4
511,Great Sound.,8
512,I thought,5
513,I was happy,5
514,but I was expecting the TV,5
515,to last 3-4 years not 9 months...,5
516,Guess I was wrong!,5
517,I was really excited,5
518,when I saw this for $ 350.,5
519,I've wanted an LED TV for a while,5
520,and could finally afford one.,5
521,Performance is just OK. pix-elates during bright flashes on the screen.,4
522,"Also color washes out at greater than 30 degree angle, can still see picture just looks like its in a bright fog.",4
523,"Head on though the picture quality is excellent,",4
524,and the features are pretty good.,5
525,One thing,5
526,that I was really disappointed in is,5
527,that I have a wii for the wife and kids,1
528,and this does not have the standard coax input,1
529,you need the HD connectors.,1
530,From what I've seen with those,5
531,it's hit,5
532,and miss on quality and picture,5
533,so I'm hoping the one,5
534,I've ordered,5
535,will be good.,5
536,All in all I think,5
537,"it is well worth the price,",6
538,but definitely not the best out there.,5
539,If I would've had more to spend,5
540,"I might have tried the TCL 48 "" LED or gotten another Vizio.",5
541,Easy set up.,3
542,"Clear picture,",4
543,However sound is very tinny had to hook up a speaker system.,8
544,Side mounted,5
545,inputs made it easy.,1
546,All in all Good deal for the price!,6
547,I was searching for an easy to use HDTV for my 90 year-old grandmother,5
548,and I am happy,5
549,I went with this RCA 42-inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV.,5
550,Setup was very easy and the remote is simple to use.,3
551,"Does come with two HDMI, PC, USB port and AV inputs for individuals",1
552,who wish to connect more components and devices.,1
553,Displays beautiful vivid colors,4
554,that are crisp and vibrant.,4
555,Sound quality is produced from two 8 watt speakers that sound clear and not muffled.,8
556,Ultra thin and weighs less than 40 pounds.,7
557,The swivel stand is an added bonus,5
558,since must table,5
559,top stands do not move.,5
560,Great value for the money and highly recommend it.,6
561,"After having this TV for just over a year,",5
562,white spots are,4
563,starting to show up all over the TV.,4
564,For that much money it's ridiculous,6
565,that the TV is already going bad.,6
566,Trying to see,5
567,"if this TV was part of a recall,",5
568,but since we've had it 14 months - seems,5
569,like we are out our money.,5
570,Don't waste your money.,6
571,The TV quality is pretty solid for the price,6
572,but within 2 months one of the lcd back lights failed.,4
573,I called Vizio,2
574,who said,2
575,"they would send out a "" TV",2
576,"we can't call new "" to me as a replacement.",2
577,This means I spent full price on a used TV.,2
578,Shipping was supposed to come a week later,2
579,but they canceled.,2
580,They rescheduled another week and by that time the entire TV went black.,2
581,So for a week I now have to sit with no TV,2
582,that I paid $ 1500 waiting for them,2
583,to bring my used TV,2
584,that I still paid $ 1500 for.,2
585,Apparently the backlight going out is a pretty common problem.,4
586,Easy to find on the internet.,5
587,In hindsight... size isn't everything.,7
588,I should have purchased a better brand.,5
589,Picture quality is OK but not fantastic.,4
590,My 5 year old Panasonic 50 inch plasma has a better picture,4
591,but this is not bad.,4
592,What is disappointing is the viewing angle.,4
593,"If you are not looking straight on at the TV,",4
594,it appears washed out.,4
595,Perhaps I just need to tune it better,5
596,but I think,5
597,my other Vizio LEDs have a better picture overall.,4
598,You will also need a good source of video,5
599,"as because it is a 70 inch,",5
600,any imperfections are seen easily.,5
601,"Even while watching basketball games,",5
602,you can see,5
603,when different cameras are used.,5
604,The White Glove service was not there either.,2
605,Pilot delivered it,2
606,and only came with one person,2
607,despite the fact,2
608,that the box clearly says,2
609,that it requires two people.,2
610,My 100lb wife had to help him carry it downstairs.,2
611,This is still a good value for the money,6
612,but had expected better.,5
613,"Wonderful television picture, size and quality are all excellent.",4
614,The price was excellent,6
615,and I highly recommend this television to anyone,5
616,who is looking for a big screen smart tv for a good price.,7
617,The only reason,5
618,I couldn't rate it,5
619,a full 5 stars is,5
620,because the sound quality is good but not great i.e.,8
621,the bass is marginal at best.,8
622,I absolutely love this TV.,5
623,Excellent picture quality and sound.,8
624,The best feature is the ease of the applications.,0
625,The user interface is very user friendly,0
626,and everything is easily accessible.,0
627,The remote makes,3
628,using this TV very easy.,3
629,"We also purchased a high end 70 "" Sony the same day we purchased this TV.",5
630,The Vizio was by far a better TV.,5
631,I wish,5
632,we had purchased 2.,5
633,Delivery was excellent and easy.,2
634,The delivery people checked the TV,2
635,before leaving.,2
636,This is my favorite TV ever.,5
637,I bought the TV at Fry's after salesperson assured,5
638,me headphones would work with this TV,5
639,"however after buying two different sets of headphones,",5
640,I realized its not the headphones but the audio outputs on the TV,1
641,that are not functioning.,1
642,Got online for website,2
643,shown on owners manual,5
644,shown tclusa.com,2
645,and it has apparently been shut down,2
646,(only has ads for amazon TVs,5
647,and not support or contact numbers).,2
648,I would not recommend this company,2
649,because they have no reliable support system in the US.,2
650,Frustrating!,5
651,I own the last model.,5
652,Within a year the HDMI ports stopped working,1
653,and the TV would go black for about three to five seconds every few minutes.,4
654,It provided a stable but lower quality resolution picture with the composite cables.,4
655,Other people have also reported the problem.,5
656,TCL phone reps refused to let me bring it to a service center,2
657,located in a city 40 miles from my house,5
658,(I planned to drive),5
659,and insisted,2
660,I mail it to them,2
661,and pay an additional $ 50 shipping charge.,2
662,I decided not to bother fixing it,5
663,since it is just a cheapo kitchen TV.,5
664,The sound quality is okay for the price.,8
665,Never did find a code,5
666,which worked the TV through my Comcast remote.,5
667,I bought this in a rush,5
668,because my previous TV,5
669,"(a Samsung 42 "" plasma) had",5
670,gone out,5
671,and I wanted to get a replacement very quickly.,5
672,"In retrospect, I wish",5
673,I'd given myself more time and not bought the first thing,5
674,that jumped out at me.,5
675,"It's not that it's a bad TV,",5
676,it's just not great either.,5
677,"It feels smaller than 40 """,7
678,when I 'm,5
679,"watching it,",5
680,the picture is decent but not quite as nice as the Samsung,4
681,it replaced.,4
682,It has all of the inputs,1
683,I hoped for,1
684,(3 HDMI,1
685,being important to me).,5
686,"But at the end of the day, it's just an okay tv in my opinion.",5
687,"For the price, it was a pretty solid option.",6
688,"That said,",5
689,a big part of me wishes,5
690,I 'd,5
691,spent a bit more,5
692,and gotten something better.,5
693,So far so good.,5
694,Great picture quality and sound.,8
695,I was a bit nervous,5
696,about purchasing a brand I am unfamiliar with,5
697,but if works like a tv should.,5
698,It took effort,3
699,to get it connected to verizon,3
700,and I still have to use the tv,3
701,remote to turn the tv on and off,3
702,which is why I gave it 4 stars.,5
703,Its also way bigger than anticipated but that was me not getting how big a 40 in tv actually is.,7
704,Great for the price.,6
705,"I just need it for my bedroom,",5
706,so basic TV work fine.,5
707,Picture is acceptable and sound,8
708,is above average.,8
709,"I use it for Chromecast,",5
710,outcome is great.,5
711,"If you budget is under $ 300 for 40 ' TV, then this probably you best choice.",6
712,I owned a Samsung TV.,5
713,"It is definitely better than TCL,",5
714,but it costs much more.,5
715,"Again,",5
716,If you are looking for a basic TV,5
717,"(not smart TV),",5
718,I recommend it.,5

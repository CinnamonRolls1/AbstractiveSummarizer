0,The photo online and on the card,4
1,attached to the case shows foam.,4
2,Where is it?,4
3,I don't have any foam included.,4
4,There is NO way this thin! thin! thin! case would protect a pencil let alone a heavy laptop.,6
5,Don't waste your money.,4
6,Mine goes back tomorrow!,4
7,I use this case on a daily basis,4
8,and have used it for about five months and by then both strap attachments,2
9,and the handle broke,2
10,and I am already having to look for a new case.,4
11,If you are going to use this daily buy something that,7
12,is of better quality.,7
13,It looks nice,3
14,and is not very bulky,4
15,but will brake due to poor quality.,7
16,I really liked this bag.,4
17,It has room for power cables and a few other small things.,0
18,I had it for over a year,4
19,but only used it occasionally.,4
20,Unfortunately over the holidays the hand strap broke.,2
21,"Great buy, just be careful with the straps.",2
22,I bought this case at the recomendation of a friend.,4
23,"The size of the case is great,",8
24,it even fits under te seat on smaller airplanes.,8
25,"I do not need a lot of space for extras,",8
26,so this is the perfect size.,8
27,The padding is good,4
28,"and it is quite stylish. there is just enough size for a mouse, power cord, a fre CD's and a cell phone.",8
29,"I love the styling and details,",3
30,it is well thought out.,4
31,There is although one drawback.,4
32,My machine is just shy of the maximum size,4
33,allowed by th specs.,4
34,"There is a pouch inside for the computer,",8
35,and it is a tight fit,8
36,to put it in.,4
37,"This is a definite drawback,",4
38,but given the opportunity I would buy the same one again.,4
39,I love this bag,4
40,and I am so glad,4
41,that I ordered it.,4
42,I shopped around,4
43,for a few weeks and nothing is as good as this.,4
44,The quality of the bag is outstanding.,7
45,"The design is perfect to fit the laptop, batteries, pens, paperwork, etc..",0
46,The padding inside really keeps the laptop secure.,6
47,Other laptop bags,4
48,that I saw,4
49,were either bulky or super expensive.,4
50,The price on Amazon is great,5
51,however I would have definately paid more,4
52,given what is out there currently.,4
53,If you are considering this product,4
54,look no further,4
55,because this is what you have,4
56,been looking for!,4
57,From the picture on Amazon this product appeared to be of good quality.,7
58,Four,7
59,(4) weeks,7
60,after we purchased the item some of the stripping at the bottom of the bag,7
61,peeled off.,7
62,I was unable to return the item,1
63,because I had it just over the four weeks.,1
64,"I decided to keep the product and about 3 weeks from that date, one",4
65,(1) of the handles broke on the item,2
66,and left me with just the one handle,2
67,to lift the item with.,2
68,Five,7
69,(5) months later the last handle finally broke off the product.,2
70,I used this bag solely for the purpose,4
71,of carrying my laptop,4
72,and supplies.,4
73,I am very disappointed in the quality of item,7
74,given the amount of money requested.,5
75,BOTH handles on this case have broken.,2
76,The plastic handles can not stand up to normal wear,2
77,and tear.,2
78,"The case was not too bad,",4
79,but now it is useless.,4
80,I will be returning it to Kensington.,4
81,The basic concept and design would rate five stars if execution were not flawed.,4
82,The zipper pulls sacrifice function and durability for style.,7
83,"In the course of just one trip to Asia, have already had one pull come off.",7
84,The bag could also use a shoulder strap for those inevitable situations,2
85,(climbing stairs,4
86,and negotiating narrow aisles),4
87,when you can't roll the thing.,4
88,The Kensington laptop case has good protection for a laptop.,6
89,There is sufficient space,4
90,"to carry laptop accessories and a daytimer, folders, a jacket or raincoat, noise reduction earphones and munchies for the road.",8
91,I'm pleased with it,4
92,and recommend it for road warriors,4
93,"who travel frequently,",4
94,as I do.,4
95,The only drawback is having to leave it plane-side for small planes.,4
96,This bag is incredible,4
97,if you have a 17 inch laptop.,8
98,It's so hard,4
99,to find a good bag,8
100,"that'll fit my enormous laptop,",8
101,and this one more than fits the bill.,8
102,It has a really comfortable handle,2
103,if you need,4
104,"to carry it,",4
105,and has so many hidden pockets,0
106,and places to put things.,0
107,"I love it,",4
108,and can't say enough about it.,4
109,The quality is also excellent.,7
110,I highly recommend getting one.,4
111,It's worth the price.,5
112,I was very disappointed with this backpack.,4
113,It says,4
114,"it fits a 17inch notebook,",8
115,however it did not.,8
116,It is always a hassle,1
117,to return Christmas gifts -,1
118,not that it was difficult through Amazon,1
119,(very easy and hassle free) -,1
120,just the hassle,4
121,of packing up,4
122,and going to the post office.,4
123,We bought,4
124,this as a good price. that is all,5
125,I can say.,4
126,The laptop,8
127,we have,8
128,doesn't fit in it.,8
129,And,4
130,"after using the pack for less than a month,",4
131,it is ripping out already.,7
132,Definatly would not purchase again,4
133,and would not recomend.,4
134,"This is a very well made bag, nice construction, lots of pockets.",7
135,The pocket for the media player is on the inside of the bag,0
136,and there's a connector there as well with the wire running down through the bag strap to a connector outside of the bag for you,0
137,to use with your headphones with.,0
138,The bad thing about this bag is,8
139,that it barely fits my xps m1710,8
140,"and my HP Pavilion DV7-3080US cant fit at all,",8
141,which is a big disappointment.,8
142,I love this backpack.,4
143,The quality is excellent,7
144,and I love all the pockets and compartments.,0
145,I have a 15. 4 '' widescreen laptop,4
146,and it fits great.,8
147,"However,",4
148,"because my laptop is 6. 4lbs and the backpack is 6lbs,",4
149,the weight can add up fast.,4
150,I have a lot of textbooks for school and the weight of everything usually averages 40lbs.,4
151,"Granted,",4
152,the bag holds it all very well with room to spare,4
153,and it is very durable.,7
154,I bought the bag a couple years ago,3
155,and it still looks brand new.,3
156,I've also used the bag for weekend camping,4
157,(minus the laptop),4
158,and can fit all my clothes,8
159,and whatnot in it --,8
160,I love,8
161,how much,8
162,stuff it can hold.,8
163,"Also,",4
164,"once I have the bag on my back,",4
165,the straps are very comfortable.,2
166,It's just not the lightest backpack,4
167,to swing on your shoulder,4
168,and run out the door.,4
169,I purchased this bag for my husband.,4
170,He is a supervisor,4
171,and carries his laptop everywhere.,4
172,He LOVES this bag,4
173,and can't beleive the price,5
174,we were able to get it for on Amazon.com.,4
175,We have seen this same bag out in the stores for close to $ 100.,5
176,It is very well made,7
177,and protects everything inside.,6
178,If you are even,4
179,thinking about buying this bag -,4
180,GET IT!,4
181,"It looks good,",3
182,BUT the smell is really bad.,7
183,After I read the tag saying :,4
184,this item uses the chemical,7
185,"that may cause cancer, birth defect, and reproductive harm!",7
186,I shoveled it into the box,4
187,and return it immediately!,4
188,"This bag is very padded,",6
189,"has lots of compartments and space, BUT,",8
190,it's too HEAVY.,4
191,Also the straps on this bag are so firm,2
192,that they don't bend easily.,2
193,This causes my shoulders to hurt after only a few minutes.,2
194,I stopped using it.,4
195,Will have to search for something better.,4
196,I bought this bag for my 17 inch laptop..,4
197,Fits perfectly!,8
198,I have an extended battery on my laptop,4
199,"and this bag can fit my laptop, the charger, a few notebooks, pencils, pens, and few other small items.",8
200,It definetly does its job well.,4
201,It is a nice bag,4
202,my only thing is,4
203,that on the edges it,7
204,starting to peel a bit.. perhaps Its,7
205,from rubbing,4
206,on my jeans or just getting,4
207,thrown around a bit..,4
208,I take good care of my stuff..,4
209,Its better than nothing.,4
210,For the price its good..,5
211,It doesnt compare to a nice leather bag..,4
212,The price also doesnt compare to that of a leather bag..,5
213,"Overall, its a great bag.",4
214,Does what its supposed to do.,4
215,Sender sent quickly.. :),4
216,Bought this as my back up bag b/c,4
217,I am tough on my bags.,4
218,I bought to use for my court briefcase,4
219,to bring legal sized files in.,4
220,Seems very durable and a good size.,8
221,Haven't used it much yet though but I am happy with it so far!,4
222,"I am very picky about bags, purses, etc..",4
223,And a bag,4
224,for carrying my macbook pro in is not something,4
225,to be taken lightly :),4
226,After reading very helpful reviews on this I decided to give it a try and so glad,4
227,I did.,4
228,I love the material on the outside,7
229,"and it's very spacious for my 15 '' laptop and other books, folders for school.",8
230,The ONLY complaint is,4
231,that I wish,0
232,"it had small pockets on the outside for my phone, wallet, keys instead of one huge pocket",0
233,where I find myself digging for those things.,4
234,"But that is just me complaining,",4
235,because this is a really great buy.,4
236,I started using this bag in July,4
237,to carry my laptop to and from work.,4
238,Three months later and the strap ripped.,2
239,"I only carry the laptop and a few papers,",4
240,I can't understand how a laptop bag could be so cheaply made.,7
241,It's a good thing,6
242,"that it has good padding, otherwise,",6
243,it would've damaged the computer.,6
244,Very dissappointed.,4
245,"I've contacted Case Logic,",4
246,we'll see what happens.,4
247,"The case looks lovely,",3
248,and has lots of nice pockets.,0
249,"But, the first case",4
250,that I rec,4
251,'d had a defective zipper.,7
252,No problem getting it returned,1
253,and replaced.,1
254,The replacement case appeared fine -,4
255,until I used it for travel the first time.,4
256,The pad,4
257,that slips over the straps,4
258,to provide comfort,4
259,when carrying the case,4
260,"started coming apart,",7
261,"and when the fraying stops,",4
262,the pad will fall off.,7
263,"An additional note on the padded shoulder strap : The buckle on the ` adjustable shoulder strap ' does not actually fit through that shoulder pad,",2
264,so the strap can never be adjusted to anything other than short or shorter length,2
265,if you want to use that padding.,2
266,If you actually want it to go over-the-shoulder,4
267,"and across your body like a true messenger,",4
268,you can't adjust the strap,2
269,to be long enough,2
270,(unless you don't want that pad to be on your shoulder - ouch).,4
271,"This was true of both cases,",4
272,so it is simply bad design.,4
273,The bag is nice,4
274,and seems well made.,7
275,My only complaint is,4
276,that the shoulder strap is not on a metal swivel.,2
277,Sooner or later the plastic connector or the strap is going to break from wear.,2
278,I'm pretty pleased with this messenger bag.,4
279,It has loads of space,8
280,since I only own a 10 '' netbook.,4
281,"I'm not sure how well this would accommodate a larger laptop,",8
282,"but for my purposes, I've got lots of room",8
283,to spare for other goodies,8
284,and that's the biggest reason,4
285,I like it.,4
286,"As far as internal padding, it's a bit weak for my taste.",6
287,I place my netbook inside a padded sleeve,4
288,before placing it into this bag.,4
289,I like a little more protection for my computer,6
290,than what is in this bag.,6
291,"If I didn't already have a padded sleeve,",4
292,I'd probably be disappointed with this bag.,4
293,I'm also not sure how durable this material is.,7
294,"I've been using this bag daily for well over a month now and thus far,",7
295,"it has held up quite well,",7
296,but something tells,4
297,"me this is a 1-3 year use bag and not a 5-10 year bag,",7
298,"but then again, it all depends on your usage of it",4
299,and whether or not you're very hard on it.,4
300,"For my purposes and use of the bag, I am pleased.",4
301,I'm using it every day.,4
302,This is really nice case.,4
303,You can access the laptop,4
304,without needing to open the flap,0
305,and the laptop comes out easily.,4
306,I've had this for about 6 months,7
307,it has no signs of wear.,7
308,It is very durable.,7
309,"It also has a large amount of padding, probably about 1/2 ''.",6
310,The flap has three pockets ; one on the outside and two on the inside.,0
311,I have no problems,0
312,"fitting a mouse, mouse pad, charger, and headset inside it.",0
313,"However, it is too small",8
314,to fit a keyboard.,8
315,One review complains about the flap,4
316,being held in place with magnets.,4
317,This is not true.,4
318,Mine is attached with velcro.,4
319,"i swapped my mac for a smaller dell laptop xps,",4
320,"so i needed a smaller case/sleeve. the design on the site looked cute. however,",3
321,it turned out about the same size,8
322,as my higher end marc jacobs sleeve,8
323,"(which i love,",4
324,but didn't need all the space),8
325,"and the quality of this case is terrible,",7
326,"like made in china,",7
327,bought in chinatown terrible. i,7
328,suppose you get what you pay for : (,5
329,"It's pretty in the picture,",3
330,but I don't care for it much in person.,3
331,It's poor quality,7
332,and I don't trust my laptop,6
333,to be protected in it.,6
334,A few months after I bought this,4
335,I found an amazing brand name laptop case for half this price.,4
336,Too bad it's too late,4
337,"to return this one,",4
338,but I guess,4
339,I'll just keep it in my closet.,4
340,It's really good looking,3
341,and I feel,6
342,like it protects my laptop well,6
343,but sometimes the zipper gets stuck.,7
344,I have really push my macbook in.,8
345,"I have a speck hard cover on my laptop,",4
346,"which may be the reason why,",4
347,but I saw some other reviews with the same issue.,4
348,"It does fit with a case on it though, you just have to make sure",8
349,it's really in there.,8
350,If all you need to do,4
351,"is protect your MacBook,",6
352,this stylish bag is well-constructed and just the thing.,6
353,Wish it had an outer pocket,0
354,to carry the power cord.,0
355,I purchased this case for my wife for her new MBAir,4
356,and she loves it!,4
357,"The case arrived promptly,",1
358,"it is the correct size,",8
359,and works,4
360,as advertised.,4
361,"As I have never purchased a laptop case before,",4
362,I was a bit surprised,4
363,how thin it was.,3
364,It doesn't add much bulk to the super-thin MBAir,8
365,and yet provides enough protection during normal use.,6
366,It fits very nicely in my wife's purse,8
367,and looks great!,3
368,The color was great --,3
369,"as expected,",4
370,the fit was not.,8
371,The case did not line up with the ports,8
372,and it did not clip into place --,8
373,not even with persuasion!,8
374,I would not recommend this product.,4
375,"I like the case overall and I really like the color,",3
376,but what made me only give it 2 stars was the rubber bottoms.,7
377,They were a cheap white material,7
378,and got messy.,7
379,I tried,4
380,pulling them off,4
381,to put my own on at it was kind of hard to do.,4
382,Color is awesome!,3
383,Top cover fit perfect.,8
384,Bottom was a great fit on the back,8
385,but failed to latch on at the front.,8
386,The keyboard cover was great but after having it a few months,4
387,the cover is not sealing anymore.,8
388,The corners on the top and bottom are beginning to crack.,7
389,The computer does not move all that much,4
390,so I can't think of a reason,7
391,why it would begin to crack.,7
392,"Being paranoid about scratching or spilling something on my computer,",4
393,I decided to buy a hard case.,4
394,I love the color,3
395,and it was really easy to put on.,8
396,The only concern,4
397,that I really had was,4
398,that since I now had the case on my computer would still fit into the sleeve,4
399,that I had,4
400,"bought to carry it around in,",4
401,and yes it still does,4
402,even though it is a little snug.,4
403,The only reason,4
404,why it didn't get five stars,4
405,is,4
406,"because the case came with a couple of scratches,",7
407,but that was not a problem for me.,4
408,"So, I was very skeptical about a case in general.",4
409,"I wanted lime green,",3
410,and this is actually lime green...,3
411,It feels nice and rubbery,7
412,(not yucky plastic like,4
413,some covers).,4
414,"Not recommended for greasy fingers,",4
415,but I do,4
416,it anyways,4
417,and there aren't that many marks.,4
418,It's a perfect fit,8
419,(I'm just bad at taking off the top ;,8
420,though I have taken it off multiple times.),8
421,"You can see the apple logo,",4
422,"and it doesn't scratch your computer. it doesn't add too much bulk,",8
423,but it's definitely adds a little more weight,4
424,Poor quality.,7
425,"The "" quilted",7
426,""" pattern had large creases and wrinkles.",7
427,The handles felt cheap,2
428,and the white part on the bottom had black marks on it.,7
429,Then there was the overpowering chemical smell,7
430,that was nauseating.,7
431,It was a mix of chemical and mothballs.,7
432,I would have returned this bag,4
433,simply because of the smell,4
434,but the fact,4
435,it was in poor condition,7
436,was really annoying.,7
437,I would not recommend this bag.,4
438,My handle has already started to rip.,2
439,It looks similar to a lap top bag not a purse,3
440,like I was hoping.,4
441,Has good protection on the inside for the lap top,6
442,I just thought,4
443,there would be more pockets as well as not looking so cheap.,3
444,Definitely would not pay more than ten bucks for this if that.,5
445,"Looks very good, very professional, fashionable.",3
446,Material is way to cheap,7
447,and it won't last to much.,7
448,I already have a lot of problems with it.,4
449,Inside is awesome for your laptop.,8
450,I won't recommend it if you will use it everyday or for traveling.,4
451,I recently purchased my first mac for college,4
452,and I was so excited to get a new bag,4
453,to hold it.,4
454,When I saw this bag,4
455,I knew,4
456,it would be perfect,4
457,and it is!,4
458,"It has two pockets, one for the laptop itself and then one for other things such as folders or a planner.",0
459,I used this bag for classes,4
460,and attached the shoulder strap.,2
461,But after about a month of use the loops,2
462,that I hooked the shoulder strap to,2
463,started to tear.,2
464,I unfortunately had to stop using it as a class bag,4
465,but it still works great,4
466,if I am going out to study,4
467,and I just need to bring my laptop and a notebook.,4
468,The hand straps have not ripped or torn so,2
469,really I think,4
470,the problem was,4
471,that I put too much weight in the bag.,4
472,I still use it quite often and I would highly recommend this item.,4
473,It is wonderful.,4
474,It looks great,3
475,and overall it functions perfectly!,4
476,"Love the bag, protects my lap top perfectly!",6
477,"The color ir so pretty,",3
478,"matches my laptop's pink case, pink speakers and pink keyboard cover < 3",3
479,also my pink kindle case :D wich,8
480,this bag is big enough to carry it as well.,8
481,"It is very well built,",7
482,the material has good quality,7
483,and the little bag for the laptop cables is big enough,8
484,"to keep safe my macbook cables, some adapters, remote control and the pink strap",8
485,that comes with this bag.,2
486,Also it has cellphone and pens compartments,0
487,and it has as much space,0
488,"to save documents, kindle in case, glasses case, the little white bag, my speakers, some CDs and my wallet,",0
489,without deforming or looking stuffed.,0
490,I definitely recommend this bag!!!,4
491,I bought this case,4
492,based on the good reviews and the cheap price.,5
493,My wife and I have to 13. 3 ' macbooks and I had the $ 40 incase sleeve,4
494,and I got a $ 25 case logic case for my wife.,4
495,Both of those were made out of noticeably thicker material than this one.,7
496,While this case fit fine,8
497,"and looked fine,",3
498,I could tell right away,4
499,"that the material was thinner, almost paper-thin.",7
500,"I just would feel nervous putting my laptop in one of these,",4
501,you might as well not have a case at all.,4
502,I returned it,4
503,and opted for the $ 25 case logic case.,4
504,I think,4
505,it's worth the extra $ 10.,5
506,Description says,4
507,"it will fit 13. 3 inch ultrabooks,",8
508,but this is false.,8
509,Do not buy for a 13. 3 inch ultrabook.,4
510,My Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13 did not fit in it.,8
511,"Good product design,",3
512,but poor description.,4
513,I have a new 13 '',4
514,Macbook Air,4
515,and was looking for a horizontally-oriented sleeve,4
516,to put in another bag.,4
517,The price on this was good,5
518,"and the feel is generally OK,",7
519,but I have a couple of complaints.,4
520,"First, the sleeve is a bit too big for the Macbook Air.",8
521,There's still a lot of empty space,8
522,when the computer is in the sleeve.,4
523,"Second, the sleeve isn't really that protective.",6
524,The material is quite thin.,7
525,I wouldn't count on any sort of drop protection,6
526,if you happen to drop your computer,6
527,while it's in this sleeve.,6
528,"Overall, can't complain too much",4
529,but I'm on the lookout for other sleeves.,4
530,Bought this item for the Lenovo,4
531,(13 '') Yoga laptop.,4
532,Although you have to stretch the sleeve a bit around the edge of the laptop,8
533,"to zip it close,",8
534,the product is everything,4
535,I expected.,4
536,The side pocket adds a nice touch.,0
537,Cushioning/padding is adequate.,6
538,"Overall, great product for a reasonable price.",5
539,This bag is very well-made.,7
540,"When I ordered it,",4
541,I didn't realize,4
542,that it even has handles hidden at the top!,2
543,It's a little bit,8
544,bigger than my 13. 3 inch Macbook Pro,8
545,(even after I put on a hard shell),4
546,;,4
547,"so if you are looking for a snug fit,",8
548,this might not be your favorite.,8
549,But it works for me.,4
550,I especially like the front pocket.,0
551,It would be so convenient for the charger and everything else,0
552,"(e.g., a mouse).",4
553,"I loved this case,",4
554,it was so inexpensive,5
555,and my macbook air fit perfectly in it.,8
556,"Unfortunately after regular use, i.e.",4
557,I used,4
558,"it Monday-Thursday in Law School,",4
559,it already has ripped at an edge.,7
560,I am so careful with my laptop,4
561,so I'm assuming,4
562,this is from poor quality of the case.,7
563,But you do get,4
564,what you pay for.,4
565,I guess,4
566,I just thought,4
567,it would last me at least a semester not just 1 month!,4
568,I know,4
569,"this wasn't an overly expensive item,",5
570,"but at the same time, it should work for what it is advertised.",4
571,"I purchased this case for a 13 in macbook air,",8
572,and it doesn't even begin to fit.,8
573,I can not get the laptop even half way into this case.,8
574,I read many reviews prior to actually ordering,4
575,that indicated quite clearly,4
576,they had also used it for a 13 in macbook air.,4
577,I would be perfectly content if only it actually covered the item,4
578,for which it was purchased.,4
579,I does appear,4
580,as though it would fulfill my needs for a lightweight cover,4
581,to allow me to easily store my laptop around the house,4
582,without worrying about the stray scratches and scuffs.,4
583,IF ONLY IT WOULD FIT!!,8
584,An awesome lil stylish bag,3
585,that fits a Macbook Air or any other,8
586,that's slightly slightly thicker,8
587,will fit perfectly.,8
588,"It looked better in the picture,",3
589,but it was still good.,3
590,I bought,4
591,as a gift and my friend was really pleased,4
592,so it worked out.,4
593,This case is really beautiful,3
594,and fits my computer snug.,8
595,Fashionable and sleek I am pretty happy with it.,3
596,The quality isn't the best,7
597,"and I have a little tear in from commuting so much with it,",7
598,but nothing that will stop me from using it.,4
599,Great product for the price.,5
600,I purchased this to keep dust and scratches away from my new Sony Vaio Pro 13 ultrabook.,4
601,It fits beautifully,8
602,and looks great.,3
603,Product quality is also good.,7
604,"No issues with closure on the Vaio,",4
605,"regardless of direction of insertion, though it is easier",4
606,to pull it out,4
607,if you put the spine in first.,4
608,Recommend the vendor and the product.,4

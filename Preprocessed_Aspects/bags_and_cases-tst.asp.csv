0,I purchased this case,4
1,because it looked very functional...,4
2,To my surprise the rivets popped out and the zipper broke about two weeks into it's use.,7
3,I have never been disappointed by a Sampsonite product until now.,4
4,I have written to them,1
5,and received no communication in return!,1
6,I bought,4
7,this case for Dell Inspiron E1505,4
8,(15. 4 ''),4
9,screen.,4
10,It was way too small.,8
11,"This case has an inner pocket,",0
12,which is the actual spot for the laptop,4
13,to slip in.,4
14,I will say,4
15,it can only fit a 14 '' screen.,8
16,I ended up,4
17,"putting my laptop outside the inner pocket,",8
18,which barely fit.,8
19,I wish,4
20,the manufacturer noticed this problem and not listed for any 15 '' + screens.,4
21,"The case itself looks pretty high quality,",7
22,but it's too thin.,8
23,Getting the laptop in and out of the case is a huge hassle,8
24,requiring both hands and lots,4
25,of pulling.,4
26,I have a 15. 4 '' Widescreen Dell Dimensions 1501.,4
27,"It fits in there snug,",8
28,"but as I stated above, getting the computer in and out is pain",8
29,"(my wife is trying to convince me to return it,",4
30,"but I'm too lazy,",4
31,I think,4
32,we'll just keep it).,4
33,"Also,",4
34,"if you have a wireless mouse,",8
35,it bulges out.,8
36,"Again, it has to do with the case",8
37,being so thin.,8
38,To some this characteristic may be very desirable,4
39,"because the case is very low profile,",4
40,but,4
41,if you have perfiferals like a wireless mouse or a A/C adapter,4
42,"that is more than an inch thick,",4
43,it bulges out.,4
44,"There's padding, of course,",6
45,so your periferals probably will not be damaged...,6
46,it just looks kinda funny.,3
47,Functionality wise : awesome!,4
48,"Has room for a lot of stuff,",8
49,"and keeps the computer really protected,",6
50,and that's the most important feature a case,4
51,like that can have.,4
52,"Doesn't look shiny and fancy, though,",3
53,and it's something,4
54,I look,4
55,for in everything I buy.,4
56,"But it varies from a person to another, obviously.",4
57,Anyway I recommend.,4
58,Very happy with the Samsonite L35 Notebook Case.,4
59,Fits my MacBook with plenty of room.,8
60,"Lots of pokets for my mouse, mouse pad, and accessories.",0
61,Just the right size,8
62,for what I wanted.,4
63,"Nice looking, and well built.",7
64,I purchased this rolling bag about six months ago.,4
65,I travel frequently for work,4
66,and depend on this bag,4
67,to get me through airports and into and out of schools.,4
68,The telescoping handle,2
69,stopped retracting about a month ago,2
70,and an airline agent showed me how to push the little button in the rear compartment,4
71,to free the mechanism.,4
72,Picture lots of people,4
73,waiting as I unzipped the bag,4
74,"to fool with the handle on shuttle buses, in airline aisles, etc..",4
75,Then last week,4
76,the black plastic handle,2
77,that is supposed to cradle inside the other handle,2
78,snapped off the bag,2
79,as a bus driver lifted it.,4
80,I am going to contact Kensington about a refund,4
81,because the bag is still under warrantee.,4
82,I do not want a replacement,4
83,unless the bag has been redesigned.,4
84,I really liked that vertical design of this bag,8
85,because it could be pulled down aisles in planes.,4
86,I've used this once,4
87,and it really didn't meet my expectations.,4
88,I've been,4
89,looking for a carry on bag,4
90,that works for me,4
91,and this isn't it.,4
92,"Besides that, it's already",7
93,starting to fall apart.,7
94,There were several things,4
95,I liked about this bag.,4
96,Shoe storage on each side of the handle is a smart use of space.,0
97,The pockets made sense as well.,0
98,So nice organization in this bag I returned it,4
99,because I just didn't like the look,3
100,and needed more room for clothing and less for files.,0
101,This bag might be better suited to men then women.,4
102,Just personal preference.,4
103,I needed a laptop bag with wheels,4
104,since I was tired of carrying around my heavy bookbag at the airport,4
105,"... this one is great,",4
106,"so many compartments,",0
107,"the wide-set wheels help prevent it from tipping over,",4
108,and the handle is comfortable.,2
109,"My only complaint is the finishing strip on the back side at the base came off very quickly,",7
110,but I didn't really care that much.,4
111,I 've,4
112,been looking for a carry-on bag,4
113,"that would accommodate my laptop, some clothing and personnel items.",4
114,This is a well made bag,7
115,and is a dream to roll thru the airport.,4
116,It has many little compartments to pack almost anything.,0
117,A separate center compartment unzips to pull out the laptop for security at the airport.,0
118,I had been using a laptop backpack,4
119,to carry my computer and peripherals,4
120,which got extremely heavy after long periods,4
121,of hauling around.,4
122,The price is great,5
123,compared to other bags with these same features.,5
124,First time I have,4
125,been dissappointed with a product from Amazon.,4
126,Appearantly others are,4
127,having the same problem with a 17 '' laptop not fitting in the compartment.,8
128,My laptop is a standard size in the market.,4
129,The bag may look good,3
130,but that doesn't help if laptop doesn't fit.,8
131,Totally dissappointed with SwissGear and Amazon.,1
132,Like a dummy I ordered it after reading,4
133,that it doesn't fit some of the 17 '' models.,8
134,I have an HP,4
135,and it doesnt fit.,8
136,On the plus side it does have a lot of nooks and crannies to put stuff in.,0
137,Just disappointed to find out my laptop doesn't fit.,8
138,Need to leave it unzipped.,4
139,Just build it a tad bit bigger,8
140,and send my one for my idea.,4
141,You'll have the best on the market!,4
142,Nice try ` eh,4
143,I was really excited to get this backpack,4
144,because I had been carefully searching for a backpack,4
145,that had to fit my 17 inch laptop.,8
146,I received my SwissGear backpack,4
147,"and really loved all of the pockets, padded straps,",2
148,all the compartments,0
149,it had,4
150,and the durability of the fabric and the price was right.,5
151,"In the stores, this backpack would have been at least double the price.",5
152,"But,",4
153,when I tried to fit my laptop in the compartment,8
154,"it was supposed to go in,",8
155,it didn't fit.,8
156,I was really disappointed,4
157,because everything else about this backpack was really nice.,4
158,I was able to fit it in another compartment,8
159,"which fits snug,",8
160,but it doesn't have the padding or strap,2
161,that is supposed,4
162,to hold it in place.,4
163,I did decide to just keep the backpack,4
164,because of all of it's other features and other uses,4
165,I have for it and it's ability,0
166,to hold my laptop in another compartment.,0
167,My 15. 6 '' HP Pavilion dv6-1360US,4
168,(14. 9 `` X10. 15 `` X1.33 ''),4
169,barely fit inside the protective slot for laptop in this bag!,8
170,"When I put my laptop in the protective slot,",8
171,"the laptop get very close to the zipper,",8
172,and the laptop pushes against the top of the bag,8
173,(I can see laptop corners through the bag).,8
174,I have to be VERY careful to zip it to make sure,8
175,that the zipper does not scratch my laptop.,8
176,I am a little worried,4
177,about carrying weight in the bag,4
178,because it will press against the laptop.,4
179,The bag does have a bigger space by the protective slot.,6
180,"It is big enough for my laptop,",8
181,but does not have any cushion on the sides,4
182,(there is a little cushion at the bottom).,4
183,I may put my laptop here,4
184,by adding some cushion,4
185,if I feel too uncomfortable,4
186,about putting my laptop in the protective slot.,4
187,"Other than this, the bag appears to be rugged and well made.",7
188,We initially had trouble,4
189,unzipping the bag,4
190,because some zipper teeth were not aligned.,4
191,But,4
192,"after we pushed them in,",4
193,it works fine.,4
194,"As other reviewers noticed,",4
195,the mp3 slot is inside the bag.,0
196,Don't know how useful that it.,0
197,This is a well constructed product,7
198,made of quality materials.,7
199,The color is a true red,3
200,as I thought,4
201,it would be,4
202,and not a hot pink as it appears in the ad.,3
203,I have read a lot of different opinions,4
204,about what size laptop fits in it.,8
205,I have a Sony Vaio,4
206,that measures 15?1/8 inches long,4
207,and it fits nicely.,8
208,I'm not sure,8
209,that it would fit,8
210,if it were much longer.,8
211,It has many pockets for just about anything,0
212,you might want to carry,0
213,while traveling.,0
214,Not sure,4
215,why I had to pay more for it than the blue or black?,5
216,Crap.,4
217,"The "" leather "" is already peeling,",7
218,and the straps are small..,2
219,I can barely sling it over my shoulder.,2
220,It will fit a lap top.. and that is about it.,8
221,Head to TJ Maxx/Ross,4
222,and find something better,4
223,"This is a nice big bag, and super cheap,",5
224,but I wanted something,4
225,that wasn't so obviously plastic.,7
226,I also didn't like the stitching.,7
227,Just looked cheap.,7
228,Sent it back.,4
229,"Decently sized bag, a bit taller",8
230,than I had anticipated.,8
231,Serves its purpose just fine,4
232,and I'm content with the look of it.,3
233,The biggest problem is the straps.,2
234,They're made from some sort of really stiff material.,2
235,You can easily scrape/burn yourself,2
236,"if you're not careful,",2
237,or it'll hurt,2
238,if it digs into your shoulder the wrong way.,2
239,Like others,4
240,"have mentioned, it does smell.",4
241,Protip : Do not leave a ziploc of crackers in there for more than a day or two.,4
242,It will acquire the smelly essence of this bag,4
243,when you later retrieve it.,4
244,"You will taste it,",4
245,and you will not like it.,4
246,It looks exactly like the picture,3
247,and works great.,4
248,Has a couple pockets,0
249,inside that are convenient,0
250,and is definitely large enough,8
251,to hold such a large laptop.,8
252,Definitely a great value!!!,5
253,This bag is great,4
254,because it works for a larger laptop.,8
255,"Also, it has a zipper,",0
256,so you don't have to worry about things,4
257,falling out of the bag.,4
258,I use this daily at work,4
259,because I often have to change meeting rooms/work areas.,4
260,"This bag comfortably fits a laptop, notebooks, pens, etc..",8
261,"It also has little metal "" feet "" so",4
262,that the bag will sit upright,4
263,when you put it on the floor.,4
264,"The outside pocket is handy,",0
265,"but it also has pockets inside for 3 pens, and then 2 larger pockets,",0
266,which I use for my iphone and smaller items.,4
267,There's a zippered pocket inside as well.,0
268,"I have a 17 "" monitor",4
269,and looked everywhere for a case,4
270,that would work.,4
271,This one works great,4
272,and looks cute.,3
273,"I want to be clear,",4
274,the vendor,4
275,that I purchased this hunk of junk from stood up for it,4
276,and supplied a perfect replacement at no extra charge.,4
277,As far as the Case Logic bag,4
278,though I was severely disappointed.,4
279,I researched for a long time to find what I thougt,4
280,would be a good bag for my needs.,4
281,This bag was it,4
282,until I received it.,4
283,It came in with a defective zipper,7
284,"and I tried twice to contact the manufacturer Case Logic,",1
285,and they never even responded.,1
286,This from a consumer standpoint really turned me off from even considering a Case Logic in the future.,1
287,I will also never recommend their product to anyone.,4
288,I will however say the Samsonite replacement,4
289,that the vendor sent,4
290,me was great,4
291,and it worked really well on my trip.,4
292,Quality was the factor,7
293,"and the zippers on the Case Logic were substandard,",7
294,so be careful,4
295,when considering their product.,4
296,"I was happy with this bag early on.. seemingly well padded, lots of space and pockets, and an attractive design for a reasonable price.",5
297,"However, after less than 2 weeks of use, the strap",2
298,detached from one side as I,2
299,was walking down the sidewalk.,4
300,The bag swung down,4
301,"and hit the pavement on one corner,",4
302,denting in the corner of my laptop.,6
303,"Now, I did have a laptop, battery, and a few notebooks/books in the bag,",4
304,but I didn't feel,4
305,that it was significantly overloaded or heavy.,4
306,"Upon closer examination, it appeared",4
307,that the sewing/seam,7
308,attaching the strap to the bag,7
309,"is minimal, and probably not very durable",7
310,(the strap on the other side was also halfway torn out).,4
311,I was also disappointed,6
312,the padding underneath was not very effective in protecting my laptop.,6
313,"Overall, its a pretty nice-looking bag, but the seams",3
314,where the strap attaches to the bag are one pretty significant flaw... just not a durable design.,7
315,"If you do decide to purchase this bag,",4
316,be sure to keep,4
317,it loaded very lightly.,4
318,"I just bought an Acer Aspire TimelineX 13 '',",4
319,and the laptop fits perfect there.,8
320,The case design is the most comfortable,8
321,that I've had.,4
322,"It's compact, padded everywhere and with a lot of compartments.",6
323,The mesh pocket is very useful for the laptop's large power brick.,0
324,The only downside is that before 2 weeks of very mild use,7
325,(and only used it to transport the laptop one time from NY to Boston and back),4
326,and one of the corners already got ripped.,7
327,Looks like,7
328,they're not very durable.,7
329,I 'm,4
330,including a pic.,4
331,This laptop case from Case Logic is nice for a non-fancy leathery kind.,4
332,"It is a 13-14 inch case, sadly a little too small for my Toshiba.",8
333,"My Dell would be fine in it, though.",8
334,It has sufficient pockets and nice padding for the laptop compartment.,6
335,It is black and gray with lime green.,3
336,The handle is adjustable,2
337,and I think,4
338,"it would do well in the rain,",4
339,as it seems,4
340,the rain would roll right off of it.,4
341,"Overall, a nice well-made product for its level.",7
342,The messenger bag has a place for every thing,0
343,and for the price it is a great value.,5
344,I hope the handles wear well,2
345,but I would feel this about any product,4
346,made of the same material.,7
347,"The bag closes up very nice and is not baggie or sloppy looking,",3
348,"it has good form,",3
349,that's important to me.,4
350,The function of the bag and its clean lines are well thought out.,3
351,Over all a really good purchases.,4
352,It was very small and tight.,8
353,I really did not like it.,4
354,The pink flowers look really fake and cheap.,3
355,I have a case on my 13 inch macbook and its very hard,8
356,to close it.,8
357,When I got this case I got it,4
358,because it said,8
359,it would fit a 13-14 inch Notebook Laptop Computer.,8
360,I have a 14 inch,8
361,and it does not fit.,8
362,I can not zip it shut.,8
363,"Otherwise the sleeve looks nice, is pretty",3
364,and seems to be in good condition,3
365,but I gave it 2 stars,4
366,because I was misled,4
367,into purchasing this item,4
368,and it doesn't even fit my laptop.,8
369,When I received the carrying case I thought,4
370,it was very cute.,3
371,It looks exactly,3
372,as it appears in the picture.,3
373,If you like bright pink then you,3
374,'ll love this!,3
375,It sorta looks like a sticker with japanese design to it.,3
376,I have to get use to the bright pink...,3
377,it looks like it cheapens the look in a way.,3
378,But I did receive some compliments about the bag -,4
379,the japanese design is an eye catcher with the bright pink.,3
380,I purchased the package deal,5
381,($ 67,5
382,which is a good deal,5
383,compared to the one item for $ 50,5
384,you get from the apple store),5
385,...,4
386,"the carrying side bag, case sleeve, pink rubber keyboard cover",3
387,(which I love!,3
388,It's a purple pink not too bright).,3
389,"We have a Macbook Air and a Pro, both 13 '',",4
390,and we bought two of this sleeve.,4
391,"Fits very well, especially for the Pro, looks pretty, and very light weight.",8
392,One zipper isn't as smooth,7
393,"when it meets the corner,",7
394,but that's not a problem,4
395,if handled with care.,4
396,I love my pink floral carrying case for my Mac book.,3
397,It fits perfectly,8
398,and provides padding for travel.,6
399,"It's also stylish,",3
400,and matches my pink plastic cover for the laptop.,3
401,It fits nicely into a backpack,8
402,without a lot of bulk.,8
403,This case is awful.,4
404,The bottom has no way,7
405,of staying on.,7
406,Its ridiculous...,4
407,The styrofoam feet are going to fall off instantly.,7
408,The material,7
409,it is made of seems,7
410,"like it would make a good case,",7
411,but I really don't understand,4
412,why there is no way the make,8
413,"the bottom part "" snap "" on.",8
414,Extremely disappointed...,4
415,"This case looks and feels great,",3
416,but is not too good for protection.,6
417,"My laptop usually just sits on my desk,",4
418,"which is great for this case, but the first time",4
419,"I decided to take my laptop with me,",4
420,"and placed it in a sleeve inside my backpack,",4
421,the case,7
422,developed cracks all over,7
423,and part of it chipped off.,7
424,But at 1/4 the price of the Speck cases,5
425,"that I also have,",4
426,I guess,5
427,you get,5
428,what you pay for.,5
429,Update :,4
430,"after less than six months, all of the rubber feet fell off",7
431,and the bottom piece cracked to the point,7
432,that it no longer would stay on.,7
433,Went back to a Speck case about a month ago,4
434,and couldn't be happier.,4
435,It's a nice color,3
436,and has effectively protected my macbook.,6
437,"However, I've been",4
438,trying to remove it to clean my computer,8
439,and it's really difficult for it to come off.,8
440,I was only able to remove the bottom.,8
441,Heads up!,4
442,"This case is a gorgeous, bright green color.",3
443,"It's not the most well made, and the last time",7
444,I bought it,7
445,it developed a few cracks after a month or two of use.,7
446,There were a couple sharp areas of plastic,7
447,I had to file down.,7
448,"However, I bought the case again",4
449,when my old one wore out,7
450,(about 7 months after I bought it),7
451,because it's cheap,5
452,and does,5
453,what I want it to for the price.,5
454,"Plus, a lot of the more expensive cases aren't as bright as this one.",3
455,I am fussy about everything.,4
456,I love this cover.,4
457,"It clips on easily,",8
458,"the color is gorgeous Tiffany blue/green,",3
459,it has a nice satin outer and hard inner side.,3
460,The apple lite shows through,3
461,if that is a concern for you.,4
462,I got this from TopCase in record time.,1
463,It arrived two days,1
464,after I ordered it,1
465,and was in excellent condition.,1
466,"This bag might look nice,",3
467,but it is of terrible quality.,7
468,"The strap broke after only 3 months,",2
469,"and even though they kindly replaced it for me, less than 2 months later the new strap couldn't even click onto the bag",2
470,because the black piece,2
471,that holds the hook completely,2
472,ripped off.,2
473,"After emailing them several times,",1
474,they still wouldn't refund me,1
475,because they claimed,1
476,that their warranty lasts only 1 month.,1
477,Who wants a laptop case,4
478,that's only guaranteed to last one month?,4
479,"This case is such a waste of money,",5
480,it would be much more worth,4
481,it to spend a little more,4
482,to get a case,4
483,that lasts.,4
484,Very fast shipping.,1
485,"Materials are cheap, stitches along the borders are not very secure. barely fit a 14 inch hp sleek notebook.",8
486,Does not worth 25 $.,5
487,Rather spend 5 more dollars,4
488,and get a better quality bag than this trash.,7
489,It doesnt even look as sophisticate,3
490,as shown in picture ;,3
491,it look like my 2 years old sister's bag.,3
492,This bag does not fit my laptop.,8
493,The pocket inside for the laptop would fit a tablet best.,8
494,I have a 15 inch screen,4
495,and it's the only thing,4
496,I can fit in the bag.,4
497,"The bag is lovely and true to the pic,",3
498,but make sure,4
499,you know your computer size first,8
500,before you get caught up in how cute the bag looks,3
501,like I did LOL,4
502,"I purchased this for work,",4
503,as my other one didnt allow much room,4
504,to keep paper work or folders in it with the laptop.,4
505,"However, I wish",4
506,they had an outer extended compartment for my power plug.,0
507,"With the laptop, and a few folders, the bag looks and closes nice.",8
508,"If i try to put the power cord in as well,",8
509,the bag looks bulky and doesnt close right.,8
510,For now i have the power cord in the little red bag,4
511,"that comes with it,",4
512,but I carry it seperate.,4
513,Id recommend this to anyone,4
514,who doesnt plan,4
515,"on carrying much else than their laptop, some pens and a notebook,",8
516,which the cord will fit in the other side no problem.,8
517,This would be more of a personal laptop bag,4
518,"The price was good,",5
519,and it fits my 14 inch Toshiba perfectly.,8
520,It looks good,3
521,"and holds the cords, my mouse and a mouse pad.",8
522,It is lightweight.,7
523,It does come with a shoulder strap.,2
524,I picked this bag,4
525,because it had cushioning on the inside for extra protection.,6
526,The only thing,0
527,I would have liked,0
528,is an outside pocket.,0
529,But that is minor.,4
530,Love the color.,3
531,I bought this case with the intent,4
532,that it would protect my computer.,6
533,"It did the complete opposite,",6
534,and now the paint on the front part of my computer has worn off in two spots.,4
535,The front zipper,4
536,where the charger is placed,4
537,"(as pictured in the photo),",4
538,"wore a hole through the padding,",7
539,and started to scratch my computer.,7
540,Avoid this case.,4
541,The good :,4
542,"Thin but well padded, inexpensive,",5
543,and good,3
544,looking sleeve.,3
545,I loved it,4
546,when I first opened it.,4
547,"My Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro was slightly loose, but still secure in it.",6
548,I chose this sleeve over the other for the possibility,4
549,of sticking the power cord into the side pocket in a rush situation.,0
550,The bad and the ugly.,4
551,"As soon as I put my laptop in the sleeve, I noticed",4
552,that the sleeve has hidden on the inside two loops,4
553,that can be pulled out,4
554,and used,4
555,to carry the the case with your hands.,4
556,"Neat idea, except that those two loops are attached to the inside of the case with two thick metallic buttons.",4
557,"And guess what,",4
558,"as you slide your laptop in and out of the sleeve,",4
559,"they rub against the exterior of the laptop regularly,",6
560,making it ripe for scratches and marks.,6
561,Just what I needed for my delicate ultrabook.,4
562,Thankfully Amazon has easy returns and this one is going back for sure!,4
563,The sleeve gives a good protection,6
564,and looks rugged enough,7
565,to be used in backpacks or suitcases.,4
566,It's light padded,4
567,but I didn't expect a huge protection from shocks or hits by this kind of sleeves.,6
568,The downside,4
569,(that costed two stars to this review),4
570,is,4
571,that there are two small handles with metallic fastener,2
572,that are normally,2
573,stowed inside the sleeve.,2
574,The fasteners are in direct contact with the laptop,2
575,so they might end up,4
576,scratching it.,4
577,"Not much to say about this,",4
578,it's a fairly basic neoprene sleeve.,4
579,It has nice construction for $ 12.,5
580,Steel zipper glides are kept away from scratching your laptop by internal gussets of neoprene.,6
581,The external pocket is fairly big.,0
582,"Mine is black on the outside and lime green inside, an attractive combination.",3
583,"The sleeve is slightly too big for a new 13 "" Macbook Pro.",8
584,"While it's not exactly a "" custom fit "",",8
585,it works fine.,8
586,No reason to spend any more than this.,5
587,This is a nice neoprene sleeve for my MacBook Air.,4
588,The fit is perfect,8
589,and it gives a nice amount of padding.,6
590,"It probably won't protect my laptop from a fall,",6
591,but it's great for day-to-day protection,6
592,while my laptop is either at my home or tucked inside my briefcase.,4
593,My only complaint is the interior color -,3
594,the black case has a BRIGHT lime green interior.,3
595,"I don't care for it,",4
596,but no one really sees it.,4
597,"Overall, a good value.",5
598,"This might be a good case for other 13. 3 inch laptop,",4
599,but it definitely does,8
600,not fit a Macbook Air 13. 3,8
601,(2013 model).,4
602,The case is so small,8
603,that it's difficult for me to put Macbook Air into it,8
604,and I could hardly take it out of the case.,8
605,I ordered this sleeve for my Lenovo Ideapad.,4
606,The case was TOO SMALL.,8
607,"The computer fit,",8
608,but just barely.,8
609,"It's a hassle getting it in or out of the sleeve,",8
610,and the seams began to tear within a week of receiving it.,7
611,"It's not leather,",7
612,and it doesn't look like it.,7
613,"I do like the soft material inside,",7
614,and the magnetic closure is slick.,4
615,"Although it pops open regularly,",4
616,because the case is too small for the computer,8
617,it is advertised,8
618,to fit in the title.,8
619,"I got this as a gift,",4
620,"and I have the Lenovo IdeaPad U310,",4
621,which it says,4
622,is compatible.,4
623,IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE.,4
624,"The laptop doesn't fit inside,",8
625,"it's too big by about 1/2in to even fit in the opening,",8
626,not to mention having,4
627,to fit the entire height of the computer inside.,8
628,I'm going to have to buy one size bigger,8
629,if it's available.,4
630,It is a very nice-looking case,3
631,and I hope,4
632,one size bigger is available.,8
633,Great!,4
634,"Good price, quick ship, fits a regular 13 '' best.",5
635,My MacBook Pro fits very tightly inside this sleeve so expect that,8
636,to be a minor problem.,4
637,Only one I can think of though.,4
638,Very nice leather and quality product,7
639,that is definitely worth the money.,5
640,Looks good and is easy to handle,3
641,without slipping out of your hands.,4
642,Also great protection with average use.,6
643,Recommended.,4
644,Right size.,8
645,Good quality.,7
646,Great price.,5
647,Don't look further.,4
648,The Dell notebook is odd shape and leather sleeve,4
649,"(US$ 60),",4
650,or the nylon one,4
651,(US$ 30),4
652,offered by Dell are not superior to this one.,4

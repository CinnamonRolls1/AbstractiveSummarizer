0,This product does not keep a charge very long and cuts off continually.,0
1,The earpiece is very uncomfortable.,1
2,"Even at such a cheap price,",7
3,it was not a good investment.,6
4,I only used it for a couple of days,6
5,and gave up.,6
6,Save your money,6
7,and buy a better brand.,6
8,"Well, I went ahead",6
9,and bought this at the reduced price.,6
10,It was good at first and,6
11,then other people were having problems,8
12,hearing me,8
13,and I was misunderstood because of this headset.,8
14,"Thankfully, it wasn't one of my important calls",6
15,and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me.,6
16,I am returning this product,6
17,because it is just not worth it to me,6
18,if the other person can not hear me properly.,8
19,I do like the design of it and the fact,5
20,that you get to choose,1
21,how you place it in your ear.,1
22,I don't care about it otherwise.,6
23,No problem setting the unit up with my Moto phone.,2
24,But nobody could hear me,8
25,when I used the headset.,8
26,"Maybe I'm expecting too much,",6
27,"since this is my first try at a Bluetooth headset,",6
28,but IMO it's useless.,6
29,This is my first bluetooth headset.,6
30,I must say,6
31,it works great with my Motorola V360 cell phone.,6
32,"I get good sound quality,",8
33,and people can hear me very clearly.,8
34,"Judging from all the other reviews say,",6
35,I must be one of the lucky ones,6
36,that has an ear,6
37,made for this headset.,6
38,"It fits great in my ear,",1
39,and the over the ear piece is just right for me.,1
40,I can wear it around for an extended period of time,1
41,and it's not uncomfortable.,1
42,Battery life seems to be very good on it as well.,0
43,I don't know,6
44,why you'd pay $ 50 + for a headset,7
45,when this one works so well for so much less.,7
46,"For the money, this is a great little addition to your bluetooth enhancement on your cell phone.",7
47,Beats a wired ear plug.,6
48,Just follow the instructions and off you go.,6
49,Make sure,6
50,you pair up the two as instructed for Bluetooth 1. 2.,2
51,Why pay 60 bucks or more for one,7
52,when you can get this for 20?,7
53,This is a good product so far.,6
54,"The item is well made,",3
55,the fit is,1
56,"c omfortable but the sound quality is extremely poor, anytime I received a incoming call",8
57,the party on the other end had great difficulity,8
58,hearing me.,8
59,I was extremely dissapointed with this motorrola headset,6
60,after owning several in the past.,6
61,I owned one of these headsets for five years,6
62,and it was fantastic!,6
63,Never had problems,6
64,"keeping the charge,",0
65,"always worked,",6
66,always warned me,0
67,when it was about to lose its charge.,0
68,It finally wore out like all electronics do,3
69,so I purchased a new one.,6
70,This one is terrible.,6
71,It won't always link with the phone.,2
72,People complain,8
73,that they can't hear me.,8
74,It doesn't warn me,0
75,"when it's about to lose its charge,",0
76,just shuts off.,0
77,I would not recommend this headset to anyone.,6
78,Seller service is excellent!,6
79,Speedy delivery.,6
80,I would buy from them again.,6
81,Product :,6
82,It is decent for my BB-Tour.,6
83,Sound quality is selective.,8
84,Some days are better than others.,8
85,I have had lower numbered models,6
86,that work much better.,6
87,Fits the ear nicely.,1
88,Good for general driving usage.,6
89,If you are looking for something,6
90,to conduct business or you,6
91,need a high quality bluetooth.,6
92,Investigate other models.,6
93,"This Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset is very light, compact",5
94,"(fits in the smallest purse),",6
95,and comfortable.,1
96,I've had this product for a few weeks now,6
97,"and I am very satisfied with its performance, in fact",6
98,it is so comfortable,1
99,that I forget,1
100,that I am wearing it.,1
101,The sound quality is good,8
102,and it works very well with my Motorola phone and its features.,2
103,I would recommend this product to anyone,6
104,who wants a headset,6
105,that works well,6
106,and is easy on your wallet.,7
107,"I have owned my H700 for several years,",6
108,paired it with a Carbo unit,2
109,"attached to a non bluetooh phone, a Razr, and a Blackberry with excelent results in every case.",2
110,I have left it alone in a drawer for several months at one point,6
111,(actuially `` lost '',6
112,it for awhile),6
113,and have been,6
114,using it on a daily basis with my Blackberry,6
115,and am still getting excelent connection results,2
116,including volume range and noise.,8
117,It has excellent recharge time and charge life.,0
118,It is so comfortable I frequently forget to take it off,1
119,(almost wore it into the shower once.),6
120,I have been looking for an excuse,6
121,to buy a unit,6
122,that is less obvious on my ear,6
123,(I have very short hair),6
124,so have not been treating the unit with great care.,6
125,I carry it in my pocket with my car keys,6
126,and recently managed to dislodge the chorme or silver trim on the boom with no damage to performance.,6
127,Wanted to share a short feedback : Tried,6
128,and returned this headset.,6
129,Wanted to have a stereo headset for use with phone and music.,6
130,Here are the issues,6
131,I have with it :,6
132,- In headset mode only sound only comes on one ear,8
133,(in the manual,6
134,they state,6
135,that this is like this with all stereo headset,6
136,"to avoid microphone feedback,",6
137,but this is not true.,6
138,The Moto S9-HD has sound on both ears even in headset mode).,6
139,- The range is really poor.,2
140,They say,2
141,"it is 2 ft,",2
142,but with my laptop is was even less.,2
143,Again other headsets don't have that problem.,6
144,- The design of the ear pieces did not fit my ear anatomy very well.,1
145,I really tried for some time,1
146,but couldn't get it to be satisfactory.,1
147,- I had no clear audio in headset mode even close to the phone.,8
148,May have been an issue with my particular unit.,6
149,Got a S9-HD,6
150,after I returned this,6
151,and it is much nicer!!,6
152,"Fantastic sound, great fit and a simple practicle set up.",8
153,HOWEVER headset looses connection,2
154,when phone is in my pocket,2
155,and once the connection is lost recconection,2
156,is slow if at all.,2
157,I tried two sets with the same result.,6
158,Despite the great sound and function,8
159,this product is useless without a strong connection.,2
160,Over all I like this product.,6
161,It is portable and sweat proof.,3
162,And with the additional purchase of some acustibud ear pieces the sounds is quite good.,8
163,Now I do have a few beefs.,6
164,Number one :,6
165,The should include a USB to wall charger.,0
166,Yeah I have one,6
167,"that came with my iphone,",6
168,but this is the second accessory,6
169,that I bought,6
170,that was shipped without one.,6
171,"So maybe it is standard practice, but still kind of lame.",0
172,Second : The stock rubber ear pieces are not very good.,1
173,"Maybe it is the size of my ear canals,",1
174,but after reading a few of these I find,6
175,that I am not the only one,6
176,who thinks so.,6
177,Third : This isn't so much their fault,6
178,"as I guess just something to expect with any bluetooth headset,",6
179,but my iphone 3GS's battery barely loses any juice,6
180,"when I am using plugin headphones to listen to music,",6
181,but using these bluetooth headphones eats up about 10 % of my battery for every hour,0
182,I run.,6
183,"Plugins uses maybe 1-2 % Not the end of the world, but something",0
184,to be aware of.,6
185,"If it weren't for beefs number one and two,",6
186,I would give this product a 4. 5.,6
187,I am very pleased with this set of bluetooth headphones in general.,6
188,"Strengths : Sweat and water resistant, lighter",1
189,"than you would think, seem to disappear",1
190,"after wearing them for a couple of minutes, good volume, ride unnoticed",8
191,"when running,",1
192,"lifting weights,",6
193,"doing chores, biking",6
194,"(with a helmet),",6
195,etc..,6
196,Weaknesses :,6
197,had to buy acoustibuds,6
198,"to get them to fit properly,",1
199,the charger is large.,0
200,This latter point is both good and bad -,6
201,they could not put a mini USB port directly on the headphones,6
202,because they would not be sealed against sweat and rain.,6
203,"But, the charger",0
204,that they decided on,0
205,"is a nice stand, but large for traveling.",0
206,The ultimate question is,6
207,whether I would buy them again,6
208,if something happened to my set -,6
209,answer is yes.,6
210,This is an awesome product,6
211,IF you require SWEAT PROOF Bluetooth stereo.,2
212,- Small form factor enables more activities-Tiny rubberized buttons keep moisture out-Good sound qualityIf,8
213,you don't need sweat proof Bluetooth -,6
214,DO NOT buy this unit.,6
215,You'll be disappointed b/c :,6
216,- it has small/tiny buttons -,4
217,the sound isn't as rich as other on ear Bluetooth -,8
218,it always takes a few minutes just to put it on &,4
219,adjust it to my earI hope,4
220,this helps...,6
221,GOOD :,6
222,Setup was incredibly easy and painless ;,2
223,no codes needed.,6
224,Cheap price,7
225,(even though mine came free as an offer with my phone).,6
226,BAD :,6
227,The fit for this item is absolutely HORRIBLE for me.,1
228,"It only comes with one size ear piece,",1
229,and it WILL NOT stay in my ear.,1
230,Reception might be good.,8
231,It might not.,8
232,"I can't tell you,",6
233,since I can't hear anything,6
234,when it's hanging out of my ear.,6
235,"I was going to use this as a spare in my car,",6
236,"in case I forget my Jawbone,",6
237,"but it isn't worth leaving in the car,",6
238,"since I'll only be tempted to keep trying it,",6
239,only to result in pure and utter frustration.,6
240,"Like others, I've found",6
241,the multifunction is too sensitive.,4
242,Too easy to push,4
243,when adjusting volume.,6
244,"On the other hand, it does seat in my ear better than most Bluetooth headsets.",1
245,I am not a fan of these things,6
246,but needed one,6
247,for when I drive.,6
248,I am on my phone a lot for work.,6
249,"Over all it fits nice, keeps a charge for a long time",0
250,and is cheap.,7
251,"The downside,",6
252,people say,6
253,it sounds,8
254,"like I am in a cave,",8
255,I just tell them,6
256,I am,6
257,"and they are not invited, lol.",6
258,Several people at my office have these and all like them for the price and comfort.,7
259,Perhaps it is just mine,8
260,that does the cave noise either way,8
261,I do not care.,6
262,"I hear fine, lol.",8
263,"This is a pretty good headset,",6
264,others say,6
265,"they can hear me clearly,",8
266,and the sound is clear to me as well.,8
267,It has a plain look,5
268,"which is a real plus for me,",5
269,I don't want to look like I'm wearing geeky jewelry.,6
270,The volume level in my ear is low even at the highest setting.,8
271,In the car I have,8
272,to roll the windows up,8
273,to hear the incoming call.,6
274,At home I have to go to a quiet room.,6
275,It paired up with my HTC Droid Incredible quickly.,2
276,I occasionally hear,2
277,it say `` Disconnected '' then `` Connected '',2
278,but it has not dropped during a call.,2
279,I don't know,6
280,if you can get a better bt headset for twenty dollars.,6
281,I could not find the manual online,6
282,and the printed manual in the box is tiny.,6
283,I scanned it,6
284,so I could easily magnify it to a more readable size.,6
285,I bought this item for my PS3 as a replacement for the headset,6
286,made by SONY.,6
287,It does,6
288,"the job, no background noise is heard,",8
289,"really crisp sound,",8
290,"volume is great, really nice piece of equipment.",8
291,I recommend buying this headset instead of sony.,6
292,It does the job,6
293,and it does it well.,6
294,Charger is for wall connection,0
295,so your PS3 does not have to be ON for the headset,6
296,to be charged.,6
297,Is smaller that the SONY and more comfortable.,1
298,Easy to turn ON and OFF.,4
299,The headset is also Bluetooth 2. 1 technology instead of 2. 0,6
300,"So thats another plus,",6
301,and the price is almost free.,7
302,"Buy it,",6
303,use it,6
304,and enjoy it!!!,6
305,I bought it because of good reviews from others here.,6
306,In the first month it was good.,6
307,"But lately, it started showing troubles.",3
308,"Now, it is getting switched off",0
309,while talking even the headset is fully charged.,0
310,You can continue talking,6
311,if you turn it on again.,6
312,"Also, this does not fit your ear.",1
313,There are 3 different sized earloop.,1
314,None of them is fit for me. 2 of them make my ear pain after 5 minutes of use.,1
315,I dont recommend this...,6
316,"Not worth even $ 10, how can this be a Nokia product?",7
317,"Shoddy, uncomfortable, crappy sound, won't stay in the ear.",8
318,"Go for Jabra or Samsung, not Nokia,",6
319,when it comes to Bluetooth tooth earpieces.,6
320,I love my $ 25 Jabra.,6
321,I hate this thing.,6
322,I bought this Bluetooth to use with my Nokia cell phone.,6
323,This one has problems with sound.,8
324,The person on the other side usually has lot of issues with the sound quality.,8
325,Everything else is okay.,6
326,The earpiece is comfortable,1
327,and battery life is not bad either.,0
328,This works really well with my LG Env.,6
329,No problem pairing it up,2
330,or connecting.,2
331,Easy to turn on.,4
332,The only problem,6
333,which I have found with all headsets,6
334,I have used,6
335,is,6
336,they just won't pick up your voice as well as using the phone.,8
337,I'm very pleased with this headset.,6
338,It's comfortable,1
339,"and can be customized for a secure fit, easy to connect, great battery life, clear communication and most importantly for me,",8
340,the volume is GREAT!,8
341,This is the first headset,6
342,I've had,6
343,where I have to turn the volume down.,8
344,Ant the price was very reasonable too.,7
345,The only drawback is the fact,6
346,"that the power button is very small,",4
347,"but once use to it,",6
348,it represents no issue to turn on or off.,6
349,I would highly recommend this item.,6
350,A complete waste of money.,6
351,"The broke on the first usage,",3
352,Made of very cheap plastic,3
353,"and very uncomfortable, in a few minutes",1
354,they hurts your ears.,1
355,Will never again buy anything from this brand.,6
356,I used the product during an indoor workout on the elliptical.,6
357,In the middle of the first workout the product quit working,3
358,and will no longer take a charge.,0
359,"Upon review of the instructions,",6
360,it says,6
361,to keep the product away from moisture.,6
362,The fact of the matter...,6
363,the product can not tolerate ANY moisture,3
364,and it will likely crash and die,6
365,when it gets even a small amount of moisture.,6
366,If you plan to use this,6
367,when you might sweat...,6
368,make another selection.,6
369,"This super great Bluetooth headset,",6
370,But for some reason this to big,1
371,to fit my ears.,1
372,"And after 1 hour about,",1
373,it starting to hurt me.,1
374,So evrething about the Bluetooth is,6
375,super great the sound and the distance and the ability,8
376,to connect to my iPad 3rd gBottom line,2
377,I will not rocommend it to anyone,1
378,that want comfrtobole headset Bluetooth.,1
379,I previously went through three Motorola SD-9 and 10 bluetooth headphones.,6
380,The 9 version rusted out after seven months of intense sweating.,6
381,"The two 10 are still in decent shape,",6
382,though the button on one no longer responds as reliably.,6
383,"This product is not as sturdy or high quality in material as a Motorola,",3
384,but it pairs without a problem.,2
385,"It is louder than my Motorolas,",8
386,and the buttons are quite accessible.,4
387,The hard plastic earpieces are not comfortable for long term wear.,1
388,"Still for the money, I can not complain.",7
389,I primarily use it to listen to music or news,6
390,while working at the gym.,6
391,Very good sound.,8
392,Even a little bass.,8
393,Good battery life.,0
394,All the audio playing functions work well.,8
395,Used it quite a lot just to talk on the phone.,6
396,Sensitive microphone.,8
397,Not a complaint.,8
398,Just works best in a more quiet atmosphere.,8
399,But no one ever has a hard time,8
400,hearing me.,8
401,No one ever even realizes,6
402,I'm using headphones.,6
403,I'm impressed.,6
404,Great product.,6
405,Nobody could hear me,8
406,when I tried using this.,8
407,Unbelievable amount of static.,8
408,"I couldn't get it to unpair from the phone,",2
409,so I had to throw it out the window,6
410,to get out of range from it.,2
411,"Cheap, plastic-y, and poor sound quality.",8
412,I bought this last year,6
413,and have never been satisfied.,6
414,Its made of the cheapest of materials,3
415,and the bluetooth has a hard time staying connected.,2
416,"In addition, and more importantly the sound quality is absolutely terrible.",8
417,Next time I'll pass and so should you.,6
418,I purchased this for about $ 32,7
419,and would say,6
420,it's very average.,6
421,When speaking to friends and family,6
422,they said,6
423,it sounded similar to my speaking on a speaker phone.,8
424,I used it mostly in my car on my commute to work.,6
425,I used it for about 15 phone calls,6
426,and would say,6
427,the other person could hear me well about 70 % of the time.,8
428,One phone call,8
429,the other person couldn't understand me at all in a quiet car,8
430,so I returned this item.,6
431,I want something better quality.,3
432,This is very basic.,6
433,"Also, in daylight",6
434,"when you turn on/pff the bluetooth,",6
435,the green flashing light,4
436,(or red),6
437,is so dull,4
438,that it was difficult to tell,4
439,if the item was on or off.,4
440,Item delivery just as described!,6
441,Very easy to use and compatible with all of my phones!,2
442,Light to the ear.,1
443,I just wish,6
444,ear holder could had been of a flexible plastic,3
445,because it breaks quite easily.,3
446,This is the first headset,6
447,I've ever owned,6
448,and this is one of the best units out there.,6
449,RocketFish makes some excellent products,6
450,and this is one of their finest.,6
451,"The sound quality is great,",8
452,the style is very cool and the unit feels top quality.,5
453,I highly recommend this Bluetooth Headset.,6
454,"Fast shipping, excellent communication, and outstanding Seller.... thank you!",6
455,"The device has great sound quality, best of any bluetooth",8
456,"I've tried,",8
457,but how it hangs on your ear makes it useless.,4
458,The mic boom needs to be close to your cheek for the person on the other end,4
459,to hear,4
460,but the design does not allow this,6
461,so I have to push the mic boom close to my cheek,4
462,when I talk.,4
463,This defeats the purpose of `` hands free. '',4
464,While the sound is good,8
465,"when up next to your ear,",8
466,it is the most uncomfortable and insecure fitting ear piece,1
467,I have ever used.,1
468,It is so incredibly large,1
469,and allows for very little adjustment.,4
470,I could not deal with this while busy,6
471,doing cleaning,6
472,or trying to drive.,6
473,Something tells me long term use,6
474,would involve some throwing of said device...,6
475,Two nice things are,6
476,that it closes up nice,4
477,and is easy to turn on and pair.,4
478,I was a little disappointed with this.,6
479,Headset.,6
480,"On the plus side, the call quality is good",8
481,and the volume is decent.,8
482,On the negative side the piece,4
483,that fits in your ear,4
484,is not easy to put back on the headset,4
485,"once it comes off,",4
486,the volume buttons are not convenient,4
487,and the flap,4
488,that flips up,4
489,for charging,4
490,gets in the way.,4
491,It is not the most comfortable of headsets either.,1
492,Wind and noise cancellation are beyond incredible!,8
493,Volume is great.,8
494,The fit is the issue.,1
495,It does not fit tightly.,1
496,"It often has the `` about-to-fall-off feel '',",1
497,which causes the user to seek out a mirror,1
498,and check the fit.,1
499,Turning the head too abruptly or too much will cause the HS to fall off.,1
500,If Jabra modified the design,6
501,to use an ear gel,1
502,it would fix the fit issue.,1
503,"Jabra, please do that for the Supreme 2.",6
504,I have owned this blue tooth about 2 weeks now and absolutely love it!,6
505,The longer microphone increases the sound quality for the people I call.,8
506,Calls are crisp and clear on both ends.,8
507,I love,4
508,how the arm folds down,4
509,to turn off.,4
510,Great battery saver.,0
511,"To answer a call,",4
512,all I have to do,4
513,is extend the arm,4
514,and it quickly connects to the phone,4
515,and answers the call.,4
516,The ear hook is strong yet flexible for a comfortable fit.,1
517,It adjusts easily,4
518,without even taking it off.,4
519,Very easy to put on.,4
520,"As for the ear pad,",1
521,once you get used,1
522,"to it being a little looser,",1
523,you will love the comfort.,1
524,"Charges quickly, travels well in small places.",0
525,This is much,6
526,like having the quality of an over the head bluetooth,6
527,without all the bulk!,6
528,Well worth the price!,6
529,I agree with the other reviews,6
530,that state these headphones have pretty good sound,8
531,...,6
532,when they work.,6
533,I have had mine for about a week,3
534,and the left headphone doesn't have sound now.,8
535,I am,6
536,"assuming it is a sweat related issue,",6
537,because I only wear them to run/lift weights.,6
538,"They do not seem to be sealed very well at all,",3
539,allowing sweat or moisture in with ease.,3
540,"I will say this,",6
541,"they are quite comfortable,",1
542,the neck band doesn't touch my neck at all allowing for free movement.,1
543,Using as a bluetooth for phone calls is terrible as well.,8
544,The ear plugs block out so much sound,8
545,I feel,8
546,like I'm talking with my fingers,8
547,plugging my ears.,8
548,People on the receiving end say,8
549,it sounds,8
550,like I'm in a box.,8
551,I do not recommend these headphones,6
552,if you plan,6
553,on breaking a sweat.,6
554,I would not recommend this headphone for runners.,6
555,I bought this in a package for the motoactv.,6
556,The sound is very good and pairing is pretty easy.,8
557,"However, during my first run, within the first mile, they just came off.",1
558,Pretty annoying,6
559,when you are,6
560,"trying to focus on your pace, breathing",6
561,and have to constantly adjust your headphones.,1
562,Just to have them come off.,1
563,"Maybe for a cyclist this would work, not for runners.",6
564,Right now they are,6
565,collecting dust in my car's glove compartment.,6
566,"These were my first bluetooth headphones,",6
567,and I loved the change from corded headphones.,6
568,They stayed in place well during running.,1
569,Occasionally after I started sweating,6
570,"I would readjust them,",6
571,but not a big deal.,6
572,They never completely fell off,1
573,while running.,1
574,Battery life is sufficient.,0
575,After about a year or so it started to fail.,3
576,Other online reviews indicate,6
577,the sweat might be the culprit.,6
578,For the price I'm okay,6
579,writing them off at this point.,6
580,I use these mainly for working out.,6
581,So far they've done great over the past 2 months.,6
582,"I'd give a 5 star,",6
583,but they still don't fit exactly perfect into my ears.,1
584,The seal from the buds never completely seals,1
585,as I think,1
586,it should.,1
587,I have never found a pair,6
588,"that fit exactly though,",6
589,"so maybe I just have oddly shaped ears,",6
590,who knows.,6
591,"They sound good,",8
592,but could be slightly louder at top volume as well.,8
593,"Overall happy with the purchase though,",7
594,as they weren't expensive,7
595,(purchased on Cyber Monday),7
596,I am very happy with this product.,6
597,Works great for my morning workouts.,6
598,Battery lasts a long time.,0
599,Very comfortable to wear.,1
600,Also the different ear pieces ensure a great fit to your ears.,1
601,Really glad I purchased this product.,6
602,I use it with a Droid Bionic phone.,6
603,I really liked the color of this bluetooth.,5
604,"I bought all three models, HM1900, HM1700 and the HM1300.",6
605,This model had the most vibrant color,5
606,but I saw a similiar one for five or below.,6
607,The calls were not all that clear and callers complained of hearing feedback and not being able to hear me well on the call.,8
608,The ear piece,3
609,that goes around the ear,6
610,breaks easily on all of the models and the extra inserts,1
611,hurt my ear,1
612,making me have to purchase a new bluetooth,6
613,because the extras all broke and the others provided hurt.,6
614,If you are looking for cuteness,5
615,then get it,6
616,but the sound is horrible.,8
617,"Let's be honest,",6
618,"it's cheap,",7
619,so it acts like a cheap headset.,6
620,"Does not fit well,",1
621,"hard to hear,",8
622,picks up a lot of background noise.,8
623,"But for as often as I use it,",6
624,It gets the job done.,6
625,In terms of function it works,6
626,just as promised -,6
627,easy pairing and good clear sound.,8
628,The placement of the on/off button is a bit unreachable,4
629,when attached to the ear but just as turning it on or off,6
630,before putting it on solves that issue.,6
631,"Also, there is a function",4
632,"to turn of the indicators light,",4
633,but it hasn't bothered me yet.,6
634,"In terms of fit,",1
635,"it is a bit on the hard side,",1
636,i will try to look for another cushion in hopes,6
637,of solving that issue.,6
638,I would buy it again,6
639,I bought this product as a gift,6
640,and they say,6
641,they love it!,6
642,It connects quickly to any device,2
643,and it is recognized very quickly.,6
644,"However, the ear piece hook broke very easily after about a week wearing.",3
645,Luckily it comes with spare ear hooks.,6
646,It has been 2 weeks since using the spare and so far so good.,6
647,The first one was probably just a defect.,6
648,Works AMAZINGLY.,6
649,I bought,6
650,this for my boyfriend cause,6
651,he works all day with his hands,6
652,and he hates the headphones,6
653,hanging out and about.,6
654,"Anyway, the device is small",6
655,but fits in his ear perfectly,1
656,"and comes with extra ear pieces,",6
657,they are small and careful SO BE CAREFUL,6
658,when handeling them cause they seem easily breakable.,3
659,But it looks great,5
660,"and he loves it,",6
661,connected perfectly the first time,2
662,he connected to his phone.,2
663,The calls from him are clear and not as much background noise,8
664,as I expected and has volume control on the actual device,4
665,which is nice!,6
666,I am going to purchase one for myself soon!,6

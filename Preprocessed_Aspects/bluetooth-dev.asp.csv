0,The appearance of this Bluetooth headset looks fine.,5
1,But the microphone is basically a crap.,8
2,You will get enhanced NOISE rather than enhanced voice.,8
3,Everybody complains,8
4,that he/she can not hear me,8
5,when I use this crappy Soyo headset with my cellphone.,8
6,The earpiece for this bluetooth blocks sound out too much.,8
7,My last bluetooth could be worn all day,6
8,and I would forget,6
9,I had it on.,6
10,This unit also has a lot of issues with interruption in the conversation.,8
11,Either the party,8
12,I am speaking to,8
13,complains,8
14,that I am ` breaking up ',8
15,or I have trouble,8
16,hearing them,8
17,because they are breaking up.,8
18,"It was an inexpensive piece,",7
19,but I would still have expected better quality.,3
20,I will use this,6
21,until I find a better replacement.,6
22,"And believe me,",6
23,I will look a lot closer,6
24,at what is out there instead of wasting any money on inferior products.,6
25,I found the in-ear piece a little large for my smaller body type,1
26,(I guess,6
27,I have smaller ears as well),6
28,since it is very inflexible getting it in your ear.,1
29,"It's not the best quality product,",3
30,"but it works,",6
31,and only cost me $ 20.,7
32,The colored lights,4
33,flashing different amounts of time,4
34,"can be confusing,",4
35,you 've,6
36,"got to learn what they mean,",6
37,and if you don't use this for a while,6
38,and go back to it,6
39,like I did,6
40,"-- well you have to learn them all over again,",6
41,which was annoying.,6
42,"It really is only a mediocre product,",6
43,"but it's still a working bluetooth headset,",6
44,and for the price I paid,6
45,I can't really complain much.,6
46,"The Soyo FreeStyler 500 may be the cheapest bluetooth headset on the market,",7
47,but it works just fine.,6
48,Can't say,6
49,"how long it will last,",3
50,but it's holding up fine after a few months.,3
51,"It synced with my phone easily,",2
52,and it sounds pretty good.,8
53,"It could be a little louder,",8
54,"and the earhook isn't very good,",1
55,"but for $ 10, you won't be disappointed.",7
56,"I got this bluetooth for my 16 year old,",6
57,since he will be driving soon,6
58,and he will need one.,6
59,He just LOVES it.,6
60,And I loved the price!!,7
61,The sound is great on my end,8
62,and he says,8
63,it sounds good on his.,8
64,I would purchase it again,6
65,and recommend it to others.,6
66,This was my first bluetooth,6
67,and it was never comfortable.,1
68,I'm female have smaller ears,6
69,and wear glasses.,6
70,It's very heavy,1
71,and it pulled my ear down from the weight.,1
72,Squished my eye glasses arm to my head,6
73,and it hurt constantly.,1
74,The sound quality wasn't very good!!,8
75,It never did fit properly,1
76,so I didn't want to wear it.,1
77,I Can not recommended this headset to anyone!!!,6
78,But,6
79,if you wear glasses I can recommended the H680 Motorola!,6
80,"Lite, small, great sound, and fits great",6
81,if you have small ears or wear glasses!!!,6
82,It worked okay for a while but then it unpaired from my cell phone.,2
83,I've tried everything,6
84,and it won't pair anymore.,2
85,I bought a Jabra to replace it,6
86,and haven't had any problems.,6
87,Don't waste your money on this expensive trinket.,6
88,I have never had a bad H700.,6
89,This one has a problem with the volume,8
90,(both receiving and transmitting).,8
91,I am not a novice to this type of device,6
92,so rest assured,6
93,that I have tried everything short or taking it apart to increase the quality of audio.,8
94,I really like this model,6
95,and will probably try another one,6
96,after I get over this one,6
97,not working up to the quality standard,3
98,to which I had become accustom.,6
99,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset,6
100,(Nickel),6
101,This H700 headset is a great headset.,6
102,When I ordered this unit I was looking for something,6
103,that would have better volume and clarity than my Motorola HS850.,8
104,"The HS850 was good. But the H700 is smaller,",5
105,has better volume & seems to have longer battery life.,8
106,It also fits tighter to your head.,1
107,It also uses the same charger as my cell phone.,0
108,This makes it more convenient,4
109,when it comes time,6
110,to charge it.,0
111,It also has 3 colors,0
112,as it is charging.,0
113,Red at the start of the charge.,0
114,"Yellow half way thru the charge, and Green when is fully charged.",6
115,I have no regrets in using this headset,6
116,it works well.,6
117,Mike.,6
118,I absolutelly love this little head set.,6
119,This is my second one,6
120,as unfortunately I found out,6
121,they do not survive the washing machine very well.,6
122,It fits around the ear very well and does not intrude inside the ear canal,1
123,as some do.,6
124,Sound quality is at least as good if not better than the speaker on my cell phone.,8
125,I have been,8
126,told that sound quality of the mic is equally good by those,8
127,talking to me.,8
128,I really love the folding mic and the smooth body,4
129,when carrying it in my pocket.,6
130,This set is so comfortable,1
131,that I usually prefer to wear this instead of use my phone,1
132,"to talk, even for a short time.",6
133,I like it well enough,6
134,that,6
135,"when my local phone store stopped carrying it,",6
136,I went online,6
137,and searched,6
138,until I found one,6
139,I could,6
140,special order!,6
141,I have discovered recently,6
142,that this headset does not work well with my new Moto Droid.,2
143,Reception problems made it nearly impossible for the other person,8
144,to hear,8
145,what I was saying.,6
146,"I finally had to part with it, along with my old Moto Razor,",6
147,and replaced with a Jawbone II and a Moto Droid.,6
148,Purchased this about 3 months ago.,6
149,I write this in hope of keeping someone,6
150,of making an expensive mistake on this item.,7
151,I use this primarily during exercise,6
152,"(stationary bike, ellipical, etc.).",6
153,It has 2 major issues.,6
154,"First, it is not designed well",1
155,causing it to fit poorly around ear.,1
156,"Second, bluetooth connection works intermitently",2
157,even when is same exact position from time to time.,2
158,I recently purchased Motorola product,6
159,which works 10 times better.,6
160,I really wanted to like these.,6
161,My problem with the Jaybirds is the fitting.,1
162,"The ear buds never fill snug in your ear,",1
163,I'm constantly readjusting and readjusting.,1
164,The # 1 problem is the cord behind the neck.,1
165,I'm surprised not a lot of reviews,6
166,"mentioned this,",6
167,but the damn cord sticks to the back of your neck and,6
168,when you turn your head there goes one of the ear pieces,1
169,dangling at your shoulder,1
170,(my biggest annoyance with wired headphones).,6
171,If it was not for this,6
172,"I might have kept mine,",6
173,but I guess,6
174,this is,6
175,why there are many headphones,6
176,that are built with a sold band behind the neck.,6
177,Only buy this product,6
178,if you intend to ALWAYS use it IN AN ARMBAND.,6
179,I have used these earphones on an iPhone 3GS and T-Mobile G1.,6
180,The audio becomes VERY choppy,8
181,if the device is not within the `` optimal zone '',2
182,which is recommended in the manual.,2
183,"The `` optimal zone '' is on the right side of the body from ear, down to waist.",2
184,Therefore when my phone is in my jeans pocket the performance is terrible.,2
185,The sound cuts in and out regularly totally disrupting enjoyment of the music.,8
186,Other than this problem,6
187,(which is forcing me to return it),6
188,i find this device very good.,6
189,BUT i would also highly recommend the ACOUSTIBUDS - Premium Adapters for Earphones,8
190,if you are any way,8
191,interested in good sound quality.,8
192,The stock earbuds lose a lot of the low end,8
193,because of a poor in ear fit.,8
194,"Also, don't rely on using this for phone use.",6
195,You need to speak very loudly for the mic,8
196,to pick up the sound.,8
197,Otherwise the person on the other end wont be able to hear you.,8
198,As a Personal Trainer I workout often,6
199,so I require comfort,1
200,"and ease with my headphones,",4
201,without all those messy wires!,6
202,The JayBird provides that -,1
203,these are great headphones,6
204,although I think,6
205,I prefer the WiFi interaction better,2
206,since I use my cell phone as the music player ;,6
207,the bluetooth cuts out quite often,2
208,if you stray too far from the player -,2
209,range is about 5 feet,2
210,and I'd prefer,6
211,if the charge could hold longer.,0
212,Overall I think,6
213,these are a great product.,6
214,"I had a wireless headphone from logitech,",6
215,but they hurt my ears after about 20 minutes,6
216,wearing them.,6
217,The Jaybird are very comfortable.,1
218,"I often have them on for over 1 hour,",1
219,and sometimes forget,1
220,that I have them on.,1
221,They don't move once in place,1
222,and the sound quality is great.,8
223,I have only had them for about 1 month,6
224,"so I can't comment on how long they will last,",3
225,but,6
226,"if you take care of them,",6
227,I can't see any reason,6
228,why they wouldn't last for a few years.,6
229,This is the worst headset,6
230,I've ever owned.,6
231,It has no on or off button.,4
232,"Seriously, no on or off button.",4
233,You have to hold down the redial button,6
234,to turn it off.,6
235,"If you don't hold it down long enough,",6
236,it will redial the last person,6
237,you talk to.,6
238,If you keep the headset in your pocket,6
239,"and you bump into it,",6
240,it will redial the last person,6
241,you talked to.,6
242,You're better off getting a headset,6
243,that doesn't do butt dialing!,6
244,I have purchased this item before,6
245,and never had a problem but the last order,6
246,(I got 2),6
247,and both of them were too low.,8
248,"No matter how much I turned up the volume, it was very difficult for me to hear the person on the other end...",8
249,"but, coincidentally, THEY were able to hear conversations",8
250,my neighbors were having... thru the walls,8
251,(????),6
252,Ear piece,1
253,that attaches to the ear,1
254,feels slightly uncomfortable for me,1
255,"and after 2 hours in my ear, my earlobe becomes sore.",1
256,"The voice quality is not crystal clear,",8
257,"I have to ask people to repeat what they are saying sometimes, similar to the quality of my phones speakerphone.",8
258,"However, its sold at a great price,",7
259,"and has good compatability for my blackberry, LG encore phone, and my PS3.",2
260,"This is an excellent headset, and great for the price!",7
261,"One came with my Blackberry,",6
262,and I ordered another for a spare.,6
263,"Very durable, clarity and noise cancelling is great.",8
264,Love that it uses same charger as my blackberry as well.,0
265,For 12 bucks this was a great deal.,7
266,LG is known for making quality products,6
267,and have come a very long way.,6
268,"It easily paired to my phone,",2
269,and voice quality was pretty good.,8
270,I have no complaints about the product.,6
271,Why spend 30 dollars for a headset,6
272,that has the same quality as this one.,6
273,"It fits comfortably around the ear,",1
274,often I forgot,6
275,it was even there.,6
276,This bluetooth headset doesn't work very well.,6
277,No buds fit my ear.,1
278,"The charge slot is loose, easily gets disconnected during charging.",6
279,Network connection often gets disconnected too.,2
280,The bottomline is,6
281,that this is a cheap product. don't waste you money on it.,7
282,"Maybe I got a defective unit,",6
283,worked only for 3 months,3
284,"and then it died,",6
285,"not charging or responding,",0
286,"it worked well,",6
287,easy to use features,4
288,but I wish,6
289,it lasted long,3
290,EDIT : June 19 2010 :,6
291,"The headset randomly turns off at times,",3
292,but the battery life is good so still merits 3 stars.,0
293,"This is a very light headset,",6
294,and fits comfortably and snugly,1
295,without having to use the ear loop.,1
296,"Sound quality is fine,",8
297,and it was easy to pair it with my phone.,2
298,One added,6
299,bonus is,6
300,"that it uses the same charger as Nokia phones,",0
301,so I have to keep track of one less thing.,6
302,The headset gets,6
303,only four stars,6
304,because its range is not as good as my old Philips headset -,2
305,the max range,2
306,"for this is about twenty feet,",6
307,not even close to the 33 foot Bluetooth spec.,2
308,"When you start approaching the range limit,",2
309,"you will hear static,",8
310,and the headset will unpair,2
311,once you are out of range,6
312,without automatically repairing,4
313,when you get back.,4
314,This Nokia Bluetooth headset is perfect for beginners,6
315,who dont want to spend a hefty amount on their first bluetooth headset.,7
316,"That said,",6
317,"this is a really good headset,",6
318,it comes with 3 different size ear-buds,1
319,to find the best fit for your ear.,1
320,The sound quality is good,8
321,and the people on other end didnt find any problem with my voice.,8
322,It was easy to setup with my Samsung Galaxy S.The only problem,2
323,is that the ear-bud is too hard,1
324,"and starts hurting after a while,",1
325,but that is fine,6
326,as I dont plan,6
327,to wear it for longer durations.,6
328,The products works,6
329,like indicated.,6
330,The only small issue is the fit on the ear.,1
331,"Its OK for my ear,",1
332,but my wife had to remove the ear insert,1
333,to fit in her ear.,1
334,"However, the product works fine,",6
335,sound can be easily varied and recharge is simple.,8
336,First day was great ;,6
337,"then I couldn't get it to charge,",0
338,and then I couldn't get it to link to my Galaxy III.,2
339,"Next, a piece of the stem broke off",3
340,and it's been DOA ever since.,6
341,Pure and utter crap.,6
342,There is something,6
343,to be said,6
344,for `` you get,6
345,what you pay for... '',7
346,"I'd been generally happy with my Motorola SD-H9 bluetooth headset,",6
347,but was attracted to how this unit folded up into a hard case.,6
348,That part is fine.,6
349,What hasn't been fine is,6
350,how the sound varies every time,8
351,"I put them on,",6
352,based on how it's fitting into my ears.,6
353,"Sometimes the sound is fine,",8
354,"sometimes it's muffled,",8
355,and I haven't yet found any way,8
356,of getting that,8
357,to be consistently good.,8
358,Most bluetooth headsets have some options,1
359,"that allow adjustment in fit,",1
360,but that isn't true for this unit.,1
361,"It may work very well for some, but unfortunately not for me.",6
362,Not very durable.,3
363,Worked fairly well for a short period.,6
364,First the plastic cracked on both sides,3
365,where the adjustment/slider goes.,3
366,Taped that,6
367,and moved on.,6
368,Then it totally died,6
369,while I was using it.,6
370,Cant get any audio out of it anymore,8
371,even though it connects.,2
372,"Save your money,",6
373,try something else.,6
374,I have been through two sets.,6
375,"Love, love, love them,",6
376,but they won't last.,3
377,The manufacturer replaced my first set,6
378,"and working on my next,",6
379,but it just won't hold up to sweat.,3
380,My first one,6
381,the ear piece went out,3
382,and the second one the volume is messed up.,8
383,It is lightweight,1
384,"and I have been using the second one for at least five months sweating every morning,",3
385,but it finally toasted it.,3
386,It's hard to find a good wireless,6
387,set out there,6
388,that will hold up..,6
389,Love this headset!,6
390,Absolutely met my expectations,6
391,"(a lightweight, comfortable, over-the-head headset",1
392,that would me workout,6
393,without having to tote my iPhone around with me).,6
394,"The set sounds good, had great range",8
395,"(roughly 100 feet),",2
396,and connects easily.,2
397,It's also nicely solid feeling.,6
398,"Sometimes with headsets, in an effort",6
399,"to go for lightweight,",6
400,manufacturers have,6
401,created flimsy feeling headsets.,6
402,Not this one.,6
403,"It's solid feeling, substantial.",1
404,It doesn't feel,3
405,like it's going to break the first time,3
406,you use it.,6
407,"Yet, it's not overly heavy either.",1
408,"Basically, it's a great headset",6
409,that does exactly what it advertises.,6
410,That's 5 stars to me!,6
411,I could not get this headset to work.,6
412,It connected with my phone easily,2
413,but each time I was on the phone,2
414,it would drop and reconnect every 10 seconds,2
415,so that I couldn't use it,2
416,(even though I was sitting right next to my phone).,6
417,I returned it,6
418,and received a refund.,6
419,There's apparently no noise-cancellation in these.,8
420,Can't use it on the bicycle,6
421,without turning it around backwards.,6
422,The battery life is...,0
423,bizarre.,0
424,You can charge the thing,0
425,"until the green light comes on,",0
426,turn it on and half an hour later,0
427,"you're getting the three-tone "" low power "" noise...",0
428,or sometimes the thing will work for days,0
429,"and never give you a low-power tone,",0
430,and suddenly turn itself,0
431,because the battery's dead.,0
432,"I won't complain about them too much,",6
433,they're worth every one of the 150 cents,7
434,"I spent on them,",6
435,but they're just not very good.,6
436,I would really like it,6
437,if it would stay in my ear,1
438,or if the loop,1
439,that went around my ear,6
440,would hold it to my ear.,6
441,Other then,6
442,"that it looks great,",5
443,the price is great,7
444,and it paired up to my phone easily.,2
445,None of that matters,6
446,if I can't get it to stay in place though.,6
447,Nice unit for a person,6
448,"that can install a different loop on it,",6
449,or has a different type of holder?,6
450,It does work good.,6
451,The seller got,6
452,it here super quick as well.,6
453,Great product for the cost.,7
454,Lightweight and comfortable fit in the ear.,1
455,"Can use with or without behind the ear clip, however, you run the risk",1
456,of it falling off,6
457,without using the clip.,6
458,Since I purchased it I,6
459,have worn the clip all day,6
460,when I am working.,6
461,Sometimes I even forget,6
462,it is there.,6
463,With my hands free I don't hav eto worry,6
464,about missing any calls.,6
465,There is a slight echo,8
466,when I speak occasionally.,8
467,Based on feedback from others I can be heard clearly,8
468,when it is use.,8
469,For a economic product this is a great buy.,6
470,"Bought it used,",6
471,but you can't tell.,6
472,"It holds a charge great, is light enough",0
473,to forget,1
474,"you have it in your ear, works well in volume and mic,",8
475,and fits perfectly in my ear.,1
476,My only gripe is,6
477,that sometimes there's a small lapse between my voice,8
478,and,6
479,when it goes into the phones audio.,8
480,I haven't pinpointed the cause of this yet so it might not be the Bluetooth's fault.,6
481,Very disappointed in the performance of this headset.,6
482,I bought it for the noise reduction,8
483,to be used in an office environment,8
484,that can be a little loud at times.,8
485,I receive nothing but complaints from the people I'm talking to about the noise in the background,8
486,while using this headset.,8
487,I've even received complaints about not being heard,8
488,clearly while in my own quiet apartment.,8
489,Overall I wish,6
490,I could return it,6
491,if I didn't already throw away the packaging.,6
492,Waste of money,6
493,I purchased this bluetooth headset back on 12/29/2011.,6
494,The earpiece looks nice,5
495,but the audio quality is very bad!!!,8
496,Everyone was either telling me,8
497,that they could not hear me or,8
498,that my voice sounded muffled and far away.,8
499,I tried to use the headset in different environments and with different people,8
500,but the responses were all the same.,8
501,Please look into a different bluetooth earpiece or you will be sadly disappointed!!!,6
502,PROs :,6
503,The headset's voice prompts are helpful.,4
504,"The set up was easy, even with various and multiple simultaneous devices.",2
505,The noise-cancelling effect of the sound in the earphone.,8
506,"Easy power on-off,",4
507,just by flipping the mic boom open or closed.,4
508,CONs :,6
509,the balance and ear hook allows it ` flop around ' a bit too much for my liking.,1
510,It is on the outside and not in your ear at all.,1
511,"If you are moving around,",6
512,it feels like it going to fall off.,1
513,The voice quality on the other end of the conversation,8
514,"I have been told is very poor, and much worse than other headsets.",8
515,Bottom line,6
516,for me is the poor comfort and the poor other party quality,8
517,outweighs the good qualities.,6
518,"I am sad about this, because I really, really like some of their other products",6
519,(and I wish,6
520,those had voice,6
521,prompts).,6
522,"This headset sounds good, has great options",8
523,and is comfortable to wear.,1
524,You will get about 5-6 hours of talk time on a full battery charge.,0
525,It has active noise cancellation,8
526,and blocks out most of the background noise.,8
527,It also has easy to use voice commands for common things,4
528,like answering or ignoring a phone call,4
529,so you can answer the phone easily,4
530,without even touching your phone.,4
531,The setup was easy,4
532,and it has worked like a charm for me for three months now!,4
533,Connecting the device to my iPhone was simple.,2
534,I didn't even need to look at the directions.,4
535,Battery meter shows up at the top of the phone.,0
536,"I don't leave it on for long periods of time,",1
537,but it's comfortable,1
538,when I do have it on.,1
539,Sound quality is good,8
540,and people can hear me clearly.,8
541,"When it's not being worn the mic folds in,",4
542,"which turns it off,",4
543,so its pretty small.,6
544,I was a little concerned,6
545,for how it would feel and look.,1
546,No need to worry with this.,6
547,Mutliple sets of ear buds allows me to wear the correct size.,1
548,"I have had this for almost 2 months,",6
549,battery life is good.,0
550,No issues with device so far.,6
551,Update after several months and issues.,6
552,"Shortly after having this for 5 months,",3
553,the battery stopped charging.,0
554,Because their was moisture that,3
555,was leaking into the recharging port.,3
556,Thought it would be a simple fix with motorola.,6
557,What a headache!!!!!,6
558,They replaced it minus my shipping costs for a new one.,6
559,Had it for 2 weeks and same thing happened again.,3
560,This time motorola didn't have these in stock,6
561,and sent me an S11 Flex.,6
562,I probably will never buy another motorola product,6
563,based on quality of device and such poor customer service.,6
564,Not sure there is anything else to add.,6
565,"Its a shame,",6
566,"because I liked the device,",6
567,"but because of poor engineering and or cheap labor, its",6
568,not worth $ 5.,6
569,"These started off great, easy pairing, awesome sound and easy button control,",8
570,however within a week they would turn off and on by themselves for no reason.,3
571,I wouldn't even be wearing them,6
572,and it would happen.,6
573,I can not explain how frustrating these have been.,6
574,I would keep them,6
575,if I could just get this problem,6
576,resolved,6
577,because all the other features worked great for me.,6
578,I've owned a pair of these for about 4 months.,6
579,I use them,6
580,for running.,6
581,They are the most comfortable pair of wireless headphones,1
582,I've ever owned.,1
583,The sound is very good.,8
584,About a week ago the LED power light quit working,3
585,and now yesterday they won't turn on at all.,3
586,I will now have to deal with Motorola,6
587,in getting a replacement.,6
588,It's been a long known issue with all Motorola wireless headphones,3
589,that they can't handle sweat,3
590,so if you're using these,6
591,while working out you may want to look else where.,6
592,Had these for about six months now.,6
593,Audio quality is great,8
594,and I enjoy,6
595,listening to music while at the gym,6
596,or when going shopping.,6
597,The control buttons,4
598,(particularly the volume),4
599,could be a little tricky and not as friendly to use.,4
600,The headset is light,1
601,and fits comfortably in my ears,1
602,(though it takes some time,1
603,to find the right angel,1
604,and fit it right in).,1
605,Talk quality is a problem.. not the best and I was told I am sound,8
606,like I am inside a water tank...,8
607,luckily for me most of the use is for listening.,6
608,These headphones are fantastic.,6
609,They have great sound quality.,8
610,They are easy to use and connect to my phone.,2
611,Also they are comfy,1
612,and stay in my ears.,1
613,There are really only two things,6
614,that I would want people to be wary about are,6
615,"that they are kinda complicated to get in,",4
616,I have let 2 people try them on and they couldn't quite figure out how to do it but,4
617,once you put them in they fit.,1
618,The other thing is,6
619,if you are wearing something with a high collar,6
620,that hits the back wire,6
621,it can displace the headphones.,1
622,Other than those two things these headphones are amazing.,6
623,I gave this headset a try,6
624,because it's made by Samsung.,6
625,Big mistake.,6
626,It's real junk.,6
627,The ear hook doesn't rotate back,1
628,and the unit is very hard to put on.,1
629,The ear bud is too big and the other ones,6
630,that came as replacements aren't the same configuration as the installed one,6
631,and there are no instructions on how to install them.,4
632,The sound quality is bad,8
633,and the noise reduction sucks.,8
634,The answer switch only works,6
635,when it's in the mood.,6
636,I'm going back to the Plantronics M50,6
637,that actually works.,6
638,"No matter how high you turn it up, you can barely hear anything",8
639,"being said,",8
640,regardless of background noise.,8
641,The fit is excellent.,1
642,Feels great in my ear.,1
643,You can tell,6
644,it won't fall off,1
645,without being too tight.,1
646,The controls are simple and easy to manipulate,4
647,while it's on your head.,6
648,I REALLY wanted this thing to work,6
649,because it meets all of my requirements for a solid Bluetooth device...,6
650,...,6
651,if only I could hear my phone conversation.,8
652,The price is right for sure.,7
653,"The call recipients on the other hand can hear me fine,",8
654,but the volume is not that great,8
655,when listening to them.,8
656,"Also, it does not seem to automatically link up with my samsung galaxy s4",2
657,when I turn it on.,6
658,Not sure,6
659,if that is the phone or the blue tooth.,6
660,It seems hard to get a good fit in the ear.,1
661,So it functions at about what you would expect for the price.,6
662,I have to say,6
663,that am very happy with this bluetooth.,6
664,"For the price of this device, is pretty good.",7
665,"It doesn't have crystal clear sound,",8
666,but it's pretty decent for the price,8
667,and what I use it for.,6
668,The battery is pretty good as well.,0
669,I would recommend this device to any one,6
670,who is just looking for a basic bluetooth.,6
671,I have been very pleased with this headset.,6
672,It is easy to connect with my phone,2
673,and has sufficient volume,8
674,to be understood.,8
675,"Controls are simple and easy to learn,",4
676,and the price is very reasonable.,7

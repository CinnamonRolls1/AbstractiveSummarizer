0,Yes they have a steal toe,4
1,but they have a tag on them,5
2,that reads `` IMPORTANT WARNINGTheae shoes,5
3,(boots) have,5
4,"been designed and manufactured as, and, for use as FASHION FOOTWEAR ONLY.",4
5,"They are not for use as safety footwear,",4
6,and should not under any circumstances be worn as safety footwear... `` A warning is also stitched into the inside of the boot near the heal,4
7,that reads `` NON-SAFTY FOOTEAR `` I am a little,5
8,let down that this fact is not listed in the products description.,5
9,The reason I purchased these boots for work,5
10,and they do not meet the required safety standard.,5
11,I got,5
12,black ankle high boots like I wore back in the 90 's..,5
13,These don't come close to the quality,4
14,they had,5
15,when they were made in UK..,5
16,"Just like everything else, cheaply made shoe from China.",5
17,Leather is very thin & sole,4
18,is super soft unlike the way they were made.,4
19,They are okay boots but very sad to see quality going into the crapper along with everything,5
20,now made in China..,5
21,I'd pay $ 200. 00 for quality boots vs. $ 125. 00 for junk..,6
22,"so I order this shoe is such high hopes,",5
23,shipping was fast so thats a plus.,5
24,Now my issue,4
25,with this boots were,4
26,that they came,4
27,without any type of cushioning???,4
28,I didn't cared much but,5
29,after I tried them on i,5
30,heard a horrible squeak,5
31,coming out of them.,5
32,I concluded,5
33,that the tongue was the issue. anyways,4
34,i returned them for a pair of DR Martens Saltaire,5
35,ST boots.,5
36,This was 2 years ago so,5
37,hopefully this classic boots changed that.,5
38,I purchased the black steel toe boots.,5
39,"When they arrived,",5
40,the little piece inside the shoe,5
41,that goes at the heel,5
42,had fallen off.,2
43,There was some dried glue,4
44,where it was supposed to have been.,5
45,I just stuck it back but seriously?,5
46,I was sort of disappointed,5
47,but other than,5
48,that the boots were in good condition.,5
49,They are comfortable,1
50,after breaking them in!,1
51,Got these bad boys for Christmas.,5
52,Took awhile to break them in,5
53,but am so glad,5
54,I did.,5
55,"Very comfortable,",1
56,and I also feel tough with the steel toe.,5
57,Good for the snow too.,8
58,Would recommend for anyone,5
59,who wants traditional and sturdy Dr. Martens.,2
60,I guess,5
61,"I thought the name "" lasticity "" and the description of the stretch of this boot,",5
62,led me to believe,5
63,that it would fit a wider calf.,1
64,I could not even zip this boot up,1
65,and it did not have much stretch to it at all!,1
66,"I have about a 17 "" calf so for those of you",5
67,ladies with larger calf sizes...,5
68,this boot is not for you!,5
69,"It also appears to be a taller boot,",3
70,but I would say,3
71,it is barely mid-calf.,3
72,"Otherwise, it is a nice looking boot for the price.",6
73,Disappointed!,5
74,I learned the hard way,5
75,"that the brand name "" Aerosoles "" does not always mean comfort.",1
76,I loved the style,3
77,and tried to use shoe stretch spray,5
78,and wear multiple socks,5
79,to loosen the grip of the shoe around the width of my feet for a week or so to no avail.,1
80,"Also, the sole of the boot was very rigid and unforgiving to the the arches of my feet, thus major uncomfort",1
81,pursued my body.,1
82,"These boots have a sturdy, comfortable sole with a heel",1
83,that is easy to walk on,1
84,"and ample toe room,",7
85,"but beyond that, I am disappointed.",5
86,The material is very thin and flimsy,4
87,(don't expect the shaft,5
88,to hold up,5
89,like it does in the picture,5
90,"-- it sagged and wrinkled on my thin calves,",5
91,leaving a huge gap between the shaft and my leg).,5
92,"In short,",5
93,if you 're,5
94,"looking for comfort, affordability,",6
95,and have the calves,5
96,"to fill these out,",5
97,they are a reasonably attractive boot.,3
98,But don't expect anything beyond that.,5
99,"Given the thin quality of the material,",4
100,I doubt,2
101,these boots would last long.,2
102,I really love the boots mainly,5
103,because the bottom of the boots have traction for bad weather,8
104,which is one of the things,5
105,I was looking for.,5
106,"They also fit my small calves,",1
107,I have a little room,5
108,but that is okay.,5
109,And they have a little shine,3
110,that is natural,3
111,and I like that.,5
112,They are really comfortable,1
113,and I can wear them to work and not have to take them off all day.,1
114,I have worn them a lot since I purchased them because of the weather here in D.C.,8
115,(cold/snow/wet).,8
116,They are one of my best purchases.,5
117,Thank you.,5
118,I bought these boots,5
119,to wear to my job as a high school teacher.,5
120,I read many reviews,5
121,touting the comfort of these boots,1
122,and they were not lying.,1
123,I have worn them all day -,1
124,I mean from 7 AM until 9PM -,5
125,and my feet do not hurt at all.,1
126,"The soles are not hard either,",4
127,which helps in the Maine winter.,8
128,They do not slide easily as many soles tend to do on snow.,8
129,I would buy these boots again.,5
130,"They fit snuggly around the heel and leg,",1
131,but not too much so.,1
132,"Just enough to stay up,",5
133,I think.,5
134,Some reviews indicated,5
135,they were a bit tight ;,5
136,"however, I have no issues.",5
137,"I am not overweight,",5
138,but have athletic calves.,5
139,They fit me fine.,1
140,Great boots for the money!,6
141,"They look great,",3
142,but are very uncomfortable.,1
143,"While generally bigger overall,",5
144,the area around the ball of the foot is not comfortable.,1
145,"Also, there are pieces",5
146,inside that are very scratchy and make them not wearable.,1
147,I have several pairs of Jambu shoes,5
148,and love them.,5
149,I've always worn my normal size,7
150,(7).,5
151,I think,5
152,the low sides in this shoe is what make it too big.,7
153,It is way too sloppy for my foot.,1
154,"Also the red is not a bright red, but more of a rust.",0
155,"Could be a cute shoe,",3
156,but not for me.,5
157,Exchanging for a different style.,5
158,"Very cute shoes, though they seem to run a bit wide.",3
159,I don't know,5
160,if they need,5
161,broken in,5
162,or what but they gave me a blister on my heel and the start of a blister above my big toe...,1
163,and I only had them on for an hour just to run to the store,5
164,and come home.,5
165,They seem to be well made they just fit kinda funny.,1
166,I really like this shoe.,5
167,"It is to wide for my feet,",5
168,but because their a mary jane I can still make them work.,5
169,I wore them,5
170,the other dayand,5
171,they were very comfortable.,1
172,saw these advertised in a magazine.,5
173,Was looking for a good comfortable pair of walking shoes.,1
174,These are perfect.,5
175,"Fit as expected, true to size and extremely comfortable.",1
176,Nice looking shoes.,3
177,"These boots look good and fit great,",1
178,they have a nice thick sole with good tread.,4
179,I thought,5
180,I had finally found the perfect pair of boots.,5
181,Then the second time,8
182,I wore them both feet,8
183,leaked.,8
184,What's the point of rainboots,8
185,that don't keep your feet dry??,8
186,BIG waste of money.,6
187,Next time I'm going to LL Bean.,5
188,"So, I bought these shoes",5
189,and they were fine.,5
190,"Hardly wore them,",5
191,but it's been two years,5
192,and I had to go back to my reliable LL Beane duck boots,5
193,because these Chooka's split,2
194,after sitting in a humidified room for two years.,8
195,Buyer beware.,5
196,I buy my shoes to last.,5
197,This boots appeared great but too small.,7
198,I have always been a 8,7
199,but even with a very thin sock they were really tight.,7
200,Plus the insole was oversized,4
201,and would have to be trimmed.,4
202,I am disappointed,5
203,because they looked and felt like great boots.,3
204,Great price too,6
205,but BE AWARE.,5
206,The seller accepted a return,6
207,but I had to pay the shipping.,6
208,That cost a third of the price of the boot.,6
209,Also boots,5
210,sent in oversized mailing envelope,5
211,(which is destroyed,5
212,"when opening),",5
213,would have been nice,5
214,if they had packed one in for a return.,5
215,I had to hunt for a box,5
216,to return in.,5
217,I would not deal with this seller again.,5
218,"I love the color and craftsmanship of this boot,",0
219,however it runs about a half size small.,7
220,I bought boot socks,5
221,to wear this,5
222,and there is no way,5
223,to fit them in and my feet too.,7
224,However my roommate,5
225,who is a half to full size smaller,7
226,says,5
227,it fits great for her.,1
228,So definitely order up!,5
229,Although some other reviews scared me,5
230,"before buying this product,",5
231,I am very pleased with my new rain boots.,5
232,"They fit very comfortably, even with thicker socks.",1
233,I really like the buckle,4
234,and think,3
235,it gives the boots some cute flair.,3
236,I definitely recommend this product to anyone,5
237,who wants to have high-quality rain boots,2
238,without paying an absurd about of money.,6
239,I bought these shoes from Comet shoes on amazon.com,5
240,and wore it 2 times,2
241,before the seam came apart from the sole.,2
242,All this after just 2 regular wears...,2
243,not even a strenuous hike!,5
244,I suspect,5
245,Comet shoes is are selling counterfeit products,5
246,because Merrell shoes are more reliable.,5
247,I would not be surprised,5
248,if other sellers are,5
249,following a similar practice.,5
250,I filed,5
251,a complain about this was told there's nothing,5
252,you can do,5
253,to help,5
254,because it's been 90 days since my purchase.,5
255,It's shameful,5
256,that they only look at the date of sale and not the usage,5
257,before making a refund decision.,5
258,"These are extremely comfortable boots,",1
259,"I did order a half size larger,",7
260,I love them ;,5
261,"however, I bought them in February",5
262,and by April the inside fabric of the heel area of my right boot is torn,2
263,and falling apart.,2
264,"Obviously, a poorly made shoe or inferior materials.",4
265,I liked these shoes for the fit and comfort.,1
266,"They were waterproof at first,",8
267,but after wearing them for a few months they became quite leaky.,8
268,So,5
269,if you need something waterproof you,8
270,should probably look elsewhere.,5
271,I have hard to fit feet,5
272,since I need orthotics.,5
273,These are a little smaller,1
274,"than I'd like,",1
275,but generally ok.,1
276,I like the heel support and the height is just right to provide support,1
277,without rubbing.,1
278,Mainly I need walking shoes,5
279,that are waterproof,8
280,and so far,5
281,they 've,5
282,"been ok,",8
283,"walking through wet grass,",8
284,although haven't had a chance,5
285,to try them in rain,8
286,(keeps raining at night!).,5
287,"The color is nice, more light blue than purple.",0
288,I've tried the shoes in stores,5
289,but neither had the size,5
290,I needed.,5
291,I was super delighted to discover,5
292,Amazon was selling a third color,0
293,(grey/blue) at the same price.,0
294,"So with prime membership and tax-free, it was a done deal!",5
295,"Also, you will need to buy a 0. 5 size bigger",7
296,if you want to have a little bit of room after hiking for hours.,1
297,"Otherwise, the size",7
298,that you would normally wear,7
299,would be quite snug.,7
300,"The shoes also needed to be broken into,",1
301,but I survived my first hike this past weekend with very minor blisters.,1
302,It's very sturdy and helped steady my ankles,1
303,(I rolled them a lot,5
304,when I just wore running shoes).,5
305,"Great shoes for hiking in all kinds of weather,",8
306,that protects your feet,2
307,and keep them warm.,5
308,Thanks!,5
309,The boots in person don't have the same look as in the picture.,3
310,They are big shaft shoes!!,3
311,They are,4
312,made by two layers of thick fabric.,4
313,"So if you want a pair of casual, very casual, boots",5
314,"what is very very warm,",5
315,they may be,5
316,what you want.,5
317,It's because the way,5
318,"it's constructed,",5
319,the shafts are narrow and very very hard to put on.,1
320,I tried to adjust with the shoe laces.,5
321,It ended up not able to maintain the look.,3
322,I think,5
323,it should be told how small these boots are running,7
324,:) they are wonderful contructed boots but very small.,7
325,I have to get two size larger,7
326,to wear with a pair of socks!,7
327,not good,5
328,What I love about this boot is,5
329,how tall it is.,5
330,I live in the mountains in Colorado,5
331,and the snow gets deep,5
332,so I needed something tall.,5
333,Great color and good warmth.,0
334,What I do not like is,5
335,they are very difficult to slip on and take off.,1
336,It's like the jaws of life.,5
337,I tried them,5
338,without socks,5
339,and they slip on a little easier.,1
340,I will keep them in hoping,5
341,that they'll loosen up some.,5
342,Untying them doesn't help/work,5
343,as that is just part of the boots looks.,3
344,Maybe other buyers will have better luck.,5
345,Ordered these,5
346,because they were very much on sale,5
347,and would get here FAST!,5
348,We have snow pretty regularly,5
349,"where I live,",5
350,and I like to have a range of snow boots to keep it interesting.,5
351,I am very impressed with the warmth of this boot.,8
352,"Of course it takes a little time to lace up,",5
353,but it's not bad.,5
354,You 've,5
355,"got to be prepared for cold, wet snow,",5
356,so why not spend a little time?,5
357,I'm usually a 7 but the 6. 5 fit fine.,7
358,"These have a fairly good sole, good support, and of course great warmth, especially for synthetic insulating materials.",1
359,I'd give them 5 stars,5
360,if Timberland made them in the USA.,5
361,Wow!!!,5
362,This boots are so beautiful and comfortable.,1
363,I was so impressed how well are made.,2
364,The price was perfect for me.,6
365,I totally recommend the boots to anyone,5
366,who's looking for a great deal.,6
367,The size was right,7
368,but I couldn't get my foot,1
369,in because there was no easement like a zipper or elastic.,1
370,I was very disappointed,5
371,as I love,5
372,Fit Flop sandals and loved the style.,3
373,I had to return them.,5
374,I feel,5
375,you need to design these with a zipper.,4
376,This boot has nothing to unzip or anything flexible to make it possible to get the boot on your foot.,1
377,Ridiculous design.,5
378,"The buckle is only for looks,",4
379,and you would assume,4
380,the inner ankle has an elastic insert.,4
381,You would be wrong.,4
382,You have to literally shove and push your foot into this boot in order to get it on.,1
383,The reason,5
384,I gave it two stars,5
385,is,5
386,"that once its ON, its fine, and I love fitflops comfort.",1
387,"Get ready to ruin your nails, work up a sweat,",1
388,and scratch up your fingers getting your foot into the things though.,1
389,The boot looks great.,3
390,But was unable to slip it on as there are no side zippers.,1
391,Probably i need to order it in a larger size.,7
392,I like a pair,1
393,that i can easily slip on and not struggle to put it on.,1
394,Would recommend getting 1 size larger.,7
395,These are very comfortable.,1
396,"As other reviewers have commented,",5
397,they can be hard to get on in the first week or so.,1
398,A tab in the back would help,4
399,but may be unsightly.,3
400,The comfort exceeds the slight hassle.,1
401,Last years version of this boot was a few inches taller,7
402,and I liked it a bit better.,7
403,This current style can look a little short,3
404,if you are,3
405,looking to tuck in skinny jeans.,3
406,"Nonetheless, I will continue to buy FitFlops as long as they are",1
407,made because of the comfort.,1
408,If you plan to wear thick socks for added warmth,7
409,you may want to go up a half size if available.,7
410,These do not have a fuzzy warm interior.,4
411,"I would not suggest wearing them in a heavy rain,",8
412,although have not had any issues,8
413,while wearing them,8
414,while running errands during wet rainy Pacific NW winter.,8
415,"I like these boots,",5
416,I bought a pair last year on sale in a different color.,0
417,I waited,6
418,until the price was right,6
419,"and ordered these,",6
420,they arrived the other day.,5
421,I had to go ONE SIZE DOWN in this style boot.,7
422,I know,7
423,that from ordering the size I,7
424,usually wear last year,7
425,and had to exchange them.,7
426,They are a little difficult,1
427,"to get on the first few time,",1
428,but they do stretch,1
429,and they are just as comfy as all my other FITFLOPS.,1
430,I have a very nice collection.,5
431,I also have a thin foot.,5
432,"If you have a wide foot,",7
433,these are NOT the boots for you.,7
434,They are cute with jeans and leggings.,3
435,Thanks!,5
436,The seam on the top of the foot sits too low and rubs against the top of the foot.,1
437,Tried multiple sizes and they all had the same seam issue.,1
438,Very cute,3
439,if you don't mind a little discomfort and blisters.,1
440,I returned them.,5
441,Not worth it to me.,5
442,I was super excited to get these,5
443,"but after on the second day of use one of the metal buttons above the fringe broke off AND the zipper's leather tassel came undone,",2
444,when I tried to tie it back,2
445,it would stay tied as well.,2
446,"The shoe its self is stylish,",3
447,"but not good for an every day use. dont waste your money on these,",2
448,especially if you are looking for a shoe,2
449,to wear everyday!,2
450,"I wanted a true purple boot,",0
451,"it was a washed purplish but not a true purple,",0
452,I am always a 9. 5,7
453,but they were a little long on me.,7
454,I think overall they were a nice look.,3
455,I was looking for something comfy,1
456,that would work for fall --,1
457,"these boots are very nice, well made,",1
458,"but,",5
459,as other reviewers have pointed out : Narrow.,7
460,"My feet are medium width,",7
461,and these moccasins were tight.,1
462,"They have stretched a little,",5
463,but here's the thing -,5
464,the bottom tread is cut to this narrow width.,7
465,"Otherwise, nice,",5
466,but maybe get a size or half size up,7
467,and fill in with thick socks,7
468,to make them fit.,1
469,Minnetonka makes the best moccasins,5
470,you can buy!,5
471,The colour is beautiful,0
472,the attention to detail is great!,3
473,So well made so very comfortable!,1
474,I get tons of compliments,5
475,when I wear them!,5
476,I really love,5
477,that this is a limited edition item,5
478,and,5
479,when they are gone,5
480,they are gone,5
481,and I got them!,5
482,I love the colour plum,0
483,and it's nice to know,5
484,that my boots are special!,5
485,The shoes,5
486,I ordered,5
487,"were labeled as 10W,",7
488,but there is no way,7
489,this shoe is a wide width.,7
490,I have several pairs of shoes in this style,5
491,that are wide width,5
492,and they all fit fine right out of the box.,5
493,This shoe company needs to assess,5
494,all their shoes labeled wide width,5
495,and mark them to USA shoe size standards,5
496,so they're labeled properly,5
497,so their customers aren't wasting their time with returning shoes,5
498,that don't fit.,1
499,I ordered these a half-size up,7
500,and they still fit poorly.,1
501,I wear an average-width size,5
502,8. 5,5
503,and I'm not sure,5
504,whose foot these were intended to fit.,5
505,I rarely have problems with the size of shoes,5
506,I order online.,5
507,"The toe box is quite narrow,",1
508,which is a problem for shoes with a heel of this height.,5
509,"They also look cheap,",3
510,which I guess,5
511,"they are,",5
512,but the picture is misleading.,5
513,I am wondering,5
514,if they are worth returning or just passing off to someone with narrow feet.,5
515,I don't think I know anyone,5
516,who would wear these anyway.,5
517,I thought,5
518,the taupe would look like the picture.,3
519,It does n't.,3
520,What I received is a grayish brown shoe.,0
521,I am consistently a size 8 medium shoe.,5
522,This shoe is snug,1
523,and my toes,1
524,hurt after a wearing the shoes a few hours.,1
525,"Since this isn't a leather shoe,",4
526,it won't adjust to my feet,1
527,and so will always be just a bit too snug.,1
528,"Although, not excessively small, I would suggest",7
529,going down a half size.,7
530,I wear a thin trouser sock with this shoe,5
531,and it's still too small.,7
532,I agree with the other reviewers...,5
533,these run a little narrow.,7
534,But get the size right and these are awesome.,7
535,Lots of compliments and the stretchy band helps with the fit,1
536,--,5
537,after a few days of breaking them in I can wear them comfortably all day.,1
538,They look great with jeans -- super cute!,3
539,I would recommend ordering the wide in your normal shoe size,7
540,or go up a half size,7
541,if you normally wear a wide shoe.,7
542,"The soft pillow cushion, wide heel, and soft-arch make them the perfect all-day shoe.",1
543,This is definitely a comfortable shoe.,1
544,Fits perfect and the insole is soft,1
545,and feels great on my feet.,1
546,I wear a size 10?1/2,7
547,I chose size 11.,7
548,And it fits perfect.,1
549,"Definitely would recommend this shoe,",5
550,"looks sleek, dressy,",3
551,"not to high with the heel, and great with jeans.",3
552,Love them!,5
553,"These boots are so cute,",3
554,but the sole is made of a cheap material,4
555,and walking in them is squishes down a little...,5
556,I've worn mine about 10 times,5
557,and the heels of the shoes are falling apart.,2
558,I noticed,5
559,when I first wore them,5
560,that the heel squishes down,2
561,as you walk,5
562,and after the first few times it split open.,2
563,Ended up getting some shoe goo,5
564,and filling the entire heel with it,5
565,because the heel is hollow on the shoes.,4
566,Cute but terrible quality,4
567,if you walk like a normal person...,5
568,Very cute boots.,3
569,Matched my motorcycle jacket perfectly.,3
570,Very uncomfortable and feet,1
571,hurt after 30 minutes,1
572,of wearing,5
573,while sitting on sofa.,5
574,Very hard insole,4
575,that needs more cushion.,4
576,Great price,6
577,They are adorable,3
578,and look good,3
579,but are made of very cheap material.,4
580,I would recommend getting more than one pair,2
581,or buying higher quality boots,2
582,if you plan,2
583,on wearing them every day.,2
584,One good scrape and the black would come off.,2
585,I do like them,5
586,but I'm being honest about the quality.,5
587,I have yet to have an issue with the heel,2
588,collapsing but after reading other reviews got a tube of shoe goo in case,5
589,it happens.,5
590,They seem pretty solid to me.,2
591,These are going to be awesome for date nights with my husband but not something,5
592,that would stand up to much more than that.,5
593,"I bought these boots for a Halloween costume,",5
594,but loved them so much,5
595,that I wear them frequently.,5
596,"I got the color "" Tan """,0
597,which looks exactly as pictured on the website.,0
598,"I ordered a size 9,",7
599,and I would say,5
600,"they're just slightly too large in the foot area,",1
601,but nothing a pair of fuzzy socks won't fix.,5
602,My only problem with these boots is,5
603,that the heel is too soft.,5
604,Either the rubber,4
605,they used,5
606,"has too much give in it,",4
607,"or the heels are hollow, or SOMETHING.",4
608,"If you walk hard on your heels,",5
609,the heel of the boot kind of gives in.,2
610,"Honestly, it's not a big enough problem",5
611,for me to not wear them.,5
612,"Otherwise, they are AMAZINGLY comfortable.",1
613,"I've worn these all day while working retail,",1
614,and my feet were perfectly comfortable.,1
615,I bought this set for my first ever country concert!,5
616,"I did not want to spend a lot of money on boots,",6
617,so,5
618,"when I saw these,",5
619,I decided to give a try.,5
620,The shipping was fast,5
621,and they look exactly like the picture.,3
622,"The fit is great too, very comfortable.",1
623,I am not use to wearing high heels or anything like that,5
624,so these were a perfect fit.,1
625,"I have worn them a couple of times,",5
626,and they feel super comfy!,1
627,I wore them for more than a few hours,1
628,and my feet felt just fine.,1
629,"If you do not want to spend a lot of money on boots,",6
630,"I highly recommend these, not only are they affordable, but very comfortable!!",6

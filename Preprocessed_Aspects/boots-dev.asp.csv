0,"Advertised as leather,",4
1,but is in fact a cloth backed synthetic!,4
2,Maybe it's a DM knock off.,5
3,"It is a cheap, but not inexpensive boot.",6
4,I returned my pair due to the misleading representation.,5
5,I never put,5
6,"them on and only listed "" fit as expected """,1
7,because it was obligatory to write the review.,5
8,Beware!,5
9,These things,5
10,"while they look the same, are not.",5
11,"The leather is a less finished product, a cheaper leather",4
12,that is not soft at all.,4
13,"All in all, not near",5
14,what they were back,5
15,when they were made in England.,5
16,Made in China... sums it up.,5
17,The other reviews were right,5
18,-- Docs are not as comfortable,1
19,as they were back,1
20,when I wore them in high school.,5
21,"The leather looks cheaper,",4
22,and it's taking longer,1
23,to break them in.,1
24,"They look great, seem to be well made, however,",3
25,is a little tight across the top of foot,1
26,where the tongue is sewn to the top of boot.,1
27,"It is painful at the moment,",1
28,but will power through in hopes,5
29,of breaking them in and thus be able to enjoy for a long time.,1
30,These steel toe boots are great.,5
31,Need them for work.,5
32,They are very comfortable,1
33,and provide the protection,2
34,I need.,5
35,Will buy same thing,5
36,again when and if these wear out.,2
37,I had such high hopes for these boots,5
38,after reading all the great reviews.,5
39,I am an average sized gal,5
40,and have never had a problem,5
41,"zipping up boots,",5
42,but these were way too narrow in the foot and the shaft.,1
43,I wear a size 8 or 8. 5 normally.,7
44,I ordered the 8,7
45,"and couldn't zip them up even half way,",7
46,plus the actual foot part was too narrow.,1
47,I don't think going up half a size,7
48,"would have fixed the narrow width or the the narrow shaft,",5
49,so I just returned them for a refund.,5
50,I was really hoping,5
51,"these boots would be cute,",3
52,based on some other reviewers.,5
53,But,5
54,when I got them,5
55,"and tried them on,",5
56,I was surprised,5
57,that they were loose around my calves -,1
58,usually boots are tight on me in that area.,5
59,"Not only that, but the ankle area was really flimsy,",5
60,and collapsed in an unattractive way.,3
61,Had to return them.,5
62,I ordered these boots,5
63,and immediately sent them back.,5
64,Too big and baggy on my skinny calves.,7
65,Ironically enough I bought,5
66,these boots cause,5
67,I found a website,5
68,that specifically recommended them for `` skinny calves ''.,5
69,I wore them around the house for a while.,5
70,They seems comfy,1
71,but were clearly very cheaply made.,2
72,My quest for skinny calf boots continues...,5
73,bummer.,5
74,These are very comfortable & attractive boots for my office environment.,1
75,"I bought them before a trip to Chicago & found them to be very dry,",8
76,but that they would not protect my feet from the cold enough for long walks.,8
77,The aerosoles sole is just like on their shoes -,4
78,which is fairly thin.,4
79,The uppers fit my calf well,5
80,(in recent years,5
81,most boot uppers have been too wide for my leg).,5
82,I only wish,4
83,that they were leather.,4
84,Another positive was the lack of break-in time.,1
85,Wore them 10 hours on the first day.,5
86,I really love these boots.,5
87,They fit perfectly,1
88,and they are VERY comfortable.,1
89,I can wear them all day at work,1
90,and my feet do not hurt at all.,1
91,I am so glad,5
92,that I found these!,5
93,This shoe hurts.,1
94,"As soon as I put it on, I knew",5
95,it was a mistake,5
96,to buy them.,5
97,Where the seams are sewn along all those straps,5
98,crisscrossing the toes,5
99,it is quite irritating.,5
100,I knew,5
101,I would have blisters within minutes,1
102,of walking around in them.,1
103,I tried to take precautions,5
104,by applying band-aids,5
105,"before I went for a walk,",5
106,but they were still causing me pain.,1
107,"I love the design, the material, and the color.",0
108,BUT for that price I was expecting SUPER COMFY summer shoes.,1
109,"This is not the case,",5
110,"the inside lining is awful and hurt my feet,",1
111,If I could return them I would.,5
112,I wore them just once : (,5
113,I saw these in a magazine,5
114,and thought,5
115,they would be great for a cruise,5
116,we are,5
117,taking this summer.,5
118,I have kind of narrow feet,5
119,"and the shoe is a little tight, width wise.",7
120,I like the sole,4
121,and they are comfortable to wear around the house but not for actually walking.,1
122,They are pretty heavy too.,5
123,I have a blister after a quick two mile walk,1
124,(with socks),5
125,but am going to continue to try and break them in.,5
126,I like the toe lift,5
127,(less tripping),5
128,and they should be cooler than my Nikes.,5
129,They aren't as cute on my size 10 foot as the picture.,3
130,They used more calf muscle than my other shoes,5
131,if that matters to anyone.,5
132,I really love the design of this shoe and the 360 degrees venting concept.,3
133,Definitely agree,5
134,that you need to order a half size down maybe even a full size.,7
135,"If your foot is narrow,",1
136,I don't recommend this shoe,1
137,as it fits quite wide.,1
138,I may have to return it because of that.,5
139,Very cute shoe though!,3
140,I finally found the shoe,5
141,"that has toe coverage, yet airy, comfortable and cute.",1
142,I saw these shoes on a ad in the travel magazine,5
143,and I purchased the same color.,0
144,"The foot bed has memory foam,",4
145,and there is no break in time necessary.,1
146,Love these shoes.,5
147,"Great fit, however my socks were soaked the first time",8
148,I wore them out in the rain.,8
149,I was really upset,5
150,because they were suppose to keep my feet dry!,8
151,I returned them as a defective item back to Amazon.,8
152,These run small,7
153,and,5
154,if you have bigger calves,7
155,they won't fit,7
156,(you can't tuck your pants in).,7
157,They were a little thinner in material than the true barn boots,4
158,"I am use to,",4
159,so don't buy,2
160,if you will be needing to use for heavy work.,2
161,Definitely order a size bigger than your foot,7
162,as I followed the advice on the other buyers here.,7
163,It has pretty good traction for a rainy day,8
164,and interestingly enough I didn't slip that much on ice with these things on.,8
165,"HOWEVER, these aren't worth the price for these shoes.",6
166,After maybe two months the rubber actually starting,2
167,tearing at the side of the soles from the constant folding the rubber had gone through in my numerous walks.,2
168,"Also, the buckles at the top are pretty much there for decoration",4
169,and sometimes would come out of the buckles,4
170,to hang quite unattractively on the side.,4
171,If you 're,5
172,"looking for rainboots,",5
173,definitely go for better ones than these.,5
174,I love my red boots.,0
175,They are very sturdy,2
176,and keep the rain out.,8
177,They look good,3
178,and will last a long time,2
179,"(long after red rubber boots go out of style, I'm sure).",2
180,My one complaint is,5
181,that they kind of smell,5
182,when I wear then indoors.,5
183,But this is obviously,5
184,because it's a rubber boot,4
185,and I shouldn't be wearing them for fashion indoors anyway.,4
186,"What a great pair of boots,",5
187,not only are they cute but super comfortable and very durable.,1
188,"I spent the night with our cub scout den on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, lots of puddles and rain",8
189,most of one day my feet never hurt and never got wet...,8
190,and I looked cute!,3
191,I purchased these hiking boots specifically,8
192,because they claimed to be waterproof.,8
193,The boot even has a little tag on the side,5
194,indicating so.,5
195,Apparently Merrell is very proud of it.,5
196,"Long story short, they are anything but waterproof.",8
197,Even water-resistant would be too generous.,8
198,"As my husband aptly put it,",5
199,porous is the term,8
200,that best describes the material.,4
201,Walking through dewy grass for more than a couple of minutes will leave your feet soaking wet.,8
202,"The seams let water penetrate immediately,",8
203,which I found out,5
204,after walking through a shallow puddle.,5
205,The boot does not perform any better,8
206,at repelling water than my sandals.,8
207,It is that bad.,5
208,A complete waste of money,5
209,if you purchase these with the intention,5
210,of keeping your feet dry.,8
211,I'm not crazy about these boots.,5
212,They are very uncomfortable in the foot bed.,1
213,I can't imagine wearing these shoes to go hiking in.,1
214,My feet would be killing me.,1
215,"Sorry to say,",5
216,they went back.,5
217,I have worn Merrell hiking boots for maybe 20 years.,5
218,This would be my fourth of fifth pair.,5
219,"Although they are somewhat comfortable to wear for walking,",1
220,my feet hurt after short level ground hikes.,1
221,They rubbed on both sides of the toe area where my feet are wide,1
222,(and,5
223,why I buy Merrell boots).,5
224,I did not break them in and that could be a factor.,5
225,"They are light weight and look good, but I am disappointed in the discomfort.",1
226,I bought these shoes just before a trip to Niagara Falls,5
227,and had them shipped overnight.,5
228,Thank goodness,5
229,I read the suggestions by other reviewers,5
230,to order 1/2 size up bacause,7
231,these shoes definately run small.,1
232,"I ordered a 9,",7
233,"usually wear an 8?1/2,",7
234,and I could possibly have ordered a 9?1/2,7
235,because my toe is at the end of the shoe,1
236,(but not cramped enough for me,1
237,to be unable to wear them).,1
238,That,5
239,"being said,",5
240,these shoes really are comfortable with no break in time required.,1
241,I took them straight out of the box,5
242,and wore them to walk all around Niagara Falls,1
243,without any discomfort.,1
244,And they are waterproof!!,8
245,I tested it by wearing them on the Maid of the Mist boat ride to the bottom of the falls.,5
246,I got soaked,8
247,but my feet stayed dry!!,8
248,I would definately recommend these shoes to anyone,5
249,and I 'm,5
250,considering getting another pair for myself!,5
251,These boots are awesome!,5
252,They are perfect for being on your feet all day,1
253,and are amazingly waterproof.,8
254,My feet NEVER get wet even when the outside of the boots are soaked.,8
255,I bought supports with them,5
256,initially because I have high arches,5
257,but I didn't even end up,5
258,"needing them,",5
259,they provided adequate support themselves.,1
260,Definitely worth the money.,6
261,I was happy,5
262,"when I purchased them,",5
263,but the first I stepped into a puddle [,8
264,not even deep enough,8
265,to cover all the boot] water ran into my foot.,8
266,Then I tried them in the snow,8
267,and my feet got really wet and cold.,8
268,I wish,5
269,I could return them now.,5
270,While they are very cute,3
271,(I love the color),0
272,it's extremely hard,1
273,to get them on and off.,1
274,You have to unlace so much of the boot,5
275,to get into it...,5
276,"and then of course, you have to lace it back up.",5
277,It takes too much time.,5
278,I wish,5
279,I would have bought a zip up.,5
280,These boots are unbelievably gorgeous and blue is my favorite color.,0
281,I just wish,5
282,the heel piece wasn't so hard ;,4
283,it rubs the backs of my ankles raw,1
284,and I can not wear them but for so long.,1
285,They do have good ankle support however,1
286,which is important in icy conditions.,5
287,A good pair of boot socks or a shoe horn might be able to fix the ankle rubbing issue.,5
288,The boots are waterproof and fully lined ; very warm!,8
289,These fit well,1
290,and they are comfortable.,1
291,I would recomend them for the all the snow,8
292,we have been,5
293,having in NY.,5
294,They only issue,5
295,I have it,5
296,that I didn't realize what a pain,5
297,it would be to lace them up.,5
298,I am very excited to wear these books this winter.,5
299,They arrived quickly and without issues with the seller or the product.,5
300,They appear to be very well made,4
301,and are comfortable to wear around.,1
302,As someone,5
303,"who loves slip on/no fuss shoes,",5
304,these are a little more time intensive to unlace/relace,5
305,(loosen),5
306,to put on but they are snug,1
307,and I know,5
308,will keep my feet and legs dry and warm during the winter/snow/rain.,8
309,For the amount of money I paid,6
310,one would expect to be able to at least put them on!,6
311,Fitflop has such great soles for the footwear,5
312,"but these are so awkward to try to put on,",1
313,it requires a shoe horn,1
314,and bruises the top of the foot!,1
315,As I discarded the packing materials I am,5
316,keeping them,5
317,but will snip the stitching to at least be able to wear them.,1
318,Very disappointed.,5
319,They were comfortable,1
320,"once I finally got my foot in them,",1
321,but putting them on with socks was a task.,1
322,I had to have help,5
323,I guess,5
324,my foot was too wide from the bottom to the top of my ankle joint. they would have been perfect,1
325,if they had elastic or zipper on the side,4
326,to help with the foot going into the boot.,1
327,"Sadly, I have printed off a return label",5
328,to send these back.,5
329,"They came in,",5
330,"they looked great, and they I tried to put them on...",3
331,With all those,5
332,"saying how hard they were to get on,",5
333,"I thought """,5
334,it shouldn't be a problem,5
335,""". Wrong.",5
336,I couldn't even get them on to see how they looked,1
337,or fit,1
338,once my foot was in them!,1
339,"They looked great,",3
340,"I was excited for them,",5
341,but,5
342,"if you can't get your foot it,",1
343,it's a waste.,1
344,I can't give them a 1,5
345,because they looked nice,3
346,"and would surely have been comfortable,",1
347,but i couldn't get them on,1
348,and had to return them so no 5 either.,5
349,They are cozy warm and comfortable,1
350,just like the Fit Flops I wear all summer long.,1
351,The only problem,5
352,I have had with these,5
353,is trying to slide them,1
354,on when wearing socks.,1
355,There is friction with the suede inside,1
356,so they don't go on easily.,1
357,I need a shoe horn.,5
358,They are easy to slide off,1
359,but putting them on is difficult.,1
360,Still worth it though,5
361,once they are on.,5
362,They look great,3
363,and feel great.,1
364,I needed to replace my much loved Uggs.,5
365,I wanted extreme comfort & extreme ease,1
366,of wearing.,1
367,These boots have both.,1
368,The only thing,4
369,that could improve them,4
370,would be fleece inside.,4
371,I do kind of miss that.,5
372,"True to size, soft suede especially on ankle area, superb FitFlop comfort",1
373,(I have been a Fit Flop Fan for many years now),5
374,"and casual,",3
375,go with everything looks make this,3
376,a great find.,3
377,"I ususally don't shoe shop online,",5
378,but,5
379,"since Amazon offered free returns,",5
380,"I thought """,5
381,"what the heck "".",5
382,I have returned about 80 % of the shoes,5
383,"I ordered,",5
384,but FitFlops always fit first time!,1
385,You won't be disappointed!,5
386,I hate these.,5
387,"They do not fit well, are horribly uncomfortable",1
388,and make a squeaky noise no matter what type of floor you are walking on.,1
389,I used to be a big fan of MInnetonka,5
390,but I guess,5
391,it's not the 70,5
392,'s anymore.,5
393,You would think,1
394,they would consider comfort,1
395,but I guess,1
396,they are only going for cute..,3
397,These were very narrow.,1
398,Will have to return them.,5
399,Was sad,5
400,that my 10 year old granddaughter's Christmas gift was a bust.,5
401,Such a beautiful moccasin but a shame they didn't seem true to size.,3
402,I ordered these in a 7?1/2,7
403,which I usually wear,7
404,but sent them back because too big.,7
405,A 7 was sent to me,7
406,"but they are still too big,",7
407,I sould,7
408,have ordered a whole size down,7
409,but I didn't want to send back and wait more time to get them AGAIN!,5
410,They are awesome looking,3
411,and I do love them.,3
412,The ankle is a little too large,1
413,but that 's,5
414,because I'm petite.,5
415,I'd recommend these any day,5
416,but just be aware of the sizing.,7
417,Love the style and taupe color is perfect.,0
418,"They are a comfortable fit on width, but a little long in length.",1
419,"Normally a 9 fits perfect,",7
420,but this is a tab long.,7
421,I've worn them,5
422,and it's not an issue.,5
423,Well made and just something different to wear.,2
424,These boots are really cute and great quality.,3
425,I love wearing them with skinny jeans or with tights and a dress.,5
426,I am usually a size 6 and so I ordered a size 6.,7
427,"They are too big even with heavy socks,",7
428,so I'd say size down a half or maybe even full size.,7
429,I decided to keep mine,7
430,even though they are too big though -,7
431,the sizing issue doesn't give me any problems,1
432,"since they are flats,",1
433,and being booties are secure around the ankle.,1
434,"When I got them,",5
435,"the fringe was all crazy and going in every which direction,",4
436,"but I just smoothed down the fringe,",4
437,laid the boots on their side,3
438,and rested some heavy books on top of them for a few days.,3
439,"After that, they looked better, and then",3
440,the fringe also just naturally calmed down with time.,4
441,Great buy - love Minnetonka!,5
442,"I ordered these shoes in a wide size,",7
443,but found,5
444,that after only about an hour my toes were completely numb.,1
445,"Normally ordering my size in a wide works very well,",7
446,but not with this shoe.,7
447,It is painful!,1
448,I actually wound up wearing my sneakers for the rest of the day at work.,5
449,Not good!,5
450,"With that said,",5
451,I have these remaining things to share about this shoe :,5
452,"First, I recommend not ordering these",5
453,if you have wide feet -,5
454,they are NOT wide.,5
455,"Second,",5
456,they seem,5
457,like they fit a little `` short '' ;,1
458,if you have narrow feet,5
459,"and still want to try them,",5
460,I recommend you try 1/2 size up.,7
461,"Third, the shoes seem",2
462,well made,2
463,and appear to be decent quality.,2
464,"However, that was not enough",5
465,to make up for my suffering.,5
466,"I do not recommend this shoe or this brand,",5
467,to be honest.,5
468,Get on the ball Naturalizer ;,5
469,I expected more from you!,5
470,The reviews had said a little narrow.,7
471,"Because I am not a big person,",5
472,I thought,5
473,that would work for me.,5
474,"After wearing them for 20 minutes,",1
475,I could not wear them another second longer.,1
476,They killed my feet!,1
477,"I won't bother trying to find the right fit at this point,",5
478,I will go with other brands,5
479,I know better.,5
480,I loved the look and color,0
481,so I am disappointed,5
482,they didn't fit properly.,1
483,I absolutely love the style,3
484,and wish they fit right.,1
485,At first I thought,5
486,they were just a little snug,1
487,and they didnt ' hurt.,1
488,Once the weather got cold the shoes became more stiff and they really hurt now,1
489,so it looks like I wasted $ 40.,5
490,These shoes are very comfortable and cute.,1
491,"However, I would order one size larger than normal.",7
492,I usually wear,5
493,a B width and these are very narrow.,7
494,You'll get blisters,1
495,if you don't wear socks with them,1
496,because they're so narrow.,1
497,I ordered a half size larger,7
498,and they were still a little tight.,1
499,They're very good quality.,4
500,I am actually wearing these shoes today.,5
501,They are much more comfortable than some of my other heels of similar design and height.,1
502,The insoles are quite cushioned,1
503,and they look and feel great.,1
504,Love them!,5
505,At first I loved,5
506,them!!,5
507,Wore them all the time.,5
508,Then one night about 3 weeks,5
509,after I got them the heel collapsed.,2
510,My friend looked at the heel,5
511,and it was a hollow heel.,4
512,No support in the heel.,4
513,Very disappointed in my purchase.,5
514,These boots are adorable,3
515,and they fit perfectly.,1
516,I usually wear a 9?1/2,7
517,and ordered a 10,7
518,since there wasn't an option for the half size.,7
519,They fit great,1
520,and are pretty comfortable too.,1

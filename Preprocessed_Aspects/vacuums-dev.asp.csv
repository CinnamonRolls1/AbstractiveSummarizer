0,Like other reviewers,5
1,"have said, the Dirt Devil Power Stick is a waste of money.",5
2,"It is incredibly noisy,",4
3,but has little to show for all of the commotion.,5
4,It has below average perfomance on tile or wood floors,7
5,and is totally useless on carpet.,7
6,I threw mine out after just a year ;,5
7,"by the end of the year, I could hardly stand to use it anymore.",5
8,I just bought this,5
9,and used it two times.,5
10,"Like others said,",5
11,its very powerful.,7
12,But the power works against it.,7
13,"First of all,",5
14,"when I started it up,",3
15,it jumped out of my hands.,3
16,The noise is deafening... seriously.,4
17,"It is much, much louder than my very powerful full upright.",4
18,My ears actually were ringing,4
19,when I was done.,4
20,It also was frustrating,5
21,because the `` exhaust '' comes out at an angle,7
22,that blows around the very dirt you are about to vacuum.,7
23,The smaller amped Dirt Devil stick vac works much better.,5
24,I plan to return it for the smaller one.,5
25,"This vacuum works,",5
26,but its the LOUDEST VACUUM EVER.,4
27,"Doggies hide, people flee,",4
28,and your ears will ring.,4
29,"I have owned many vacuums and shop-vacs,",5
30,and the Dirt Devil Powerstick is the loudest of all.,4
31,I recommend earplugs with every purchase.,4
32,I concur with all of the reviews,5
33,ranging from 1-5 stars on this vacuum.,5
34,It is loud,4
35,and the exhaust does blow very strong.,5
36,These `` cons '' are attributed to the high power,7
37,that this unit has.,5
38,It picks up dirt,7
39,and long hair very well.,7
40,And,5
41,"since the vacuum head doesn't have a conventional brushroll,",0
42,it can not jam with hair.,0
43,This vacuum is used in an apartment with approximatly 800 sq. ft. with 50/50 carpet and tile floor.,5
44,It loses one star for the noise,4
45,"... although loud,",4
46,it is bearable.,4
47,For such a small machine it really does have great power.,7
48,I have four small children.,5
49,I need to sweep after every meal.,5
50,This is a lot quicker than sweeping.,5
51,"It's great to suck up cereal, crumbs, hair, etc..",5
52,Keep in mind it does not have any extra tools or a rotating brush.,0
53,It mainly has suction power.,7
54,I love it!,5
55,I bought this vacumn,5
56,because I have dogs,5
57,and I read,5
58,that it sucks very well and for simpicity of use.,3
59,It features a zero on this front.,5
60,Its noisy and the filter blocks up,4
61,after one use,5
62,so you have to clean out the whole system,0
63,and replacing the filters is more expensive than having bagged vacumn.,0
64,Its heavy and cumbersome,8
65,and does not last long belt wise.,1
66,I have to replace the belt every two months or so.,1
67,All in all not a very low maintenance vacumn.,5
68,if you just have light vacumning,5
69,and not dogs that,5
70,require daily vacumning of the house then its ok.,5
71,But one could do better,5
72,i think.,5
73,I would not purchase one like this again,5
74,I have been using this vacuum cleaner for about a year now,5
75,and I feel,5
76,it is not a good one,5
77,"(even though I like the bagless feaure, light in weight and an OK price)",6
78,here,5
79,is why :,5
80,(1),5
81,"The suction is WEAK,",7
82,many reviewers think the opposite,5
83,and I believe,5
84,they were mislead by the effect of the powerful brush!,5
85,The brush scrapped materials from the surface of the carpet,0
86,and gives false impression,5
87,that lots of dirt is collected.,5
88,(2),5
89,"It picks up dog hair and dust ok, but not even a small object on the floor",7
90,(especially bear floor,7
91,without carpet).,7
92,(3),5
93,The brush keeps rolling at high speed,5
94,even when the vacuum is in up-right position.,5
95,I think,5
96,this is really a poor design.,5
97,"(4) Very noisy, it is louder than the one",4
98,I had before,4
99,(which was truly a powerful one).,5
100,"If you are looking for serious vac,",5
101,I do not recommend this one.,5
102,I purchased this vacuum in May 2005,5
103,(my first Bissell).,5
104,I have had continuous problems with the belt,1
105,breaking or burning.,1
106,"I am on my fifth belt now,",1
107,which is about one per month.,1
108,"I have never had problems like this before, not even with my old Eureka",5
109,that I gave away,5
110,when I got this one,5
111,(I didn't go through five belts in 6 six years with the Eureka).,5
112,"Otherwise, it seems to work okay, except the Turbo Brush,",0
113,"which is basically useless,",0
114,and keep your eye on they many filters,0
115,that need to be cleaned regularly to keep it working well.,0
116,I absolutely LOVE this vaccuum!,5
117,This is my third new vaccuum in six months.,5
118,The others couldn't handle the pet hair like this one.,7
119,(Two big dogs and a cat!),5
120,"We have lots of pet hair,",5
121,and this vaccuum gets up every last bit of dirt and hair.,7
122,I love the cleaning sensor.,0
123,It turns green,0
124,when the floor is completely clean.,0
125,No more bags!!!,0
126,It's super easy to empty the dirt,0
127,and clean the filters.,0
128,"There are three filters instead of the typical two,",0
129,allowing the hepa filter,0
130,to last a longer period of time,0
131,before replacement is needed -,0
132,another plus!,0
133,The turbo brush is my favorite part of this vaccuum.,0
134,"The turbo brush has a self spinner,",0
135,making vaccuuming the couches and drapes a breeze.,5
136,The only down side to this vaccuum is,5
137,"that the turbo brush clogs easily,",0
138,and you have to take the brush apart,0
139,to remove any pet hair,5
140,that clogs it.,5
141,This is the best vaccuum,5
142,I have ever owned.,5
143,"After two previous bad experiences with vaccuums, this one is a keeper.",5
144,"This is a very good vacuume,",5
145,it has the best suction of any upright,7
146,"I've ever used,",7
147,"I like the fact its bagless,",0
148,"and I can empty the cup after each use,",0
149,it goes from carpet to ceramic tile,5
150,and does a super job on each!,5
151,you can't go wrong bying this vacuume cleaner!,5
152,and the price is right,6
153,also!!,5
154,Don't waste your money!,5
155,The only good suction,7
156,that the vac has,5
157,is thru the hose.,7
158,The hose and the power cord is very short!,3
159,I have all tile with a few rugs,5
160,and it doesn't vacuum anything up on both the tile and the rugs.,7
161,I have to keep going over the same spot over and over again just to get a couple of crumbs vacuumed.,7
162,Purchased this vac. to perform quick clean up jobs,5
163,and was quite impressed with it,5
164,when I saw it in the store,5
165,as it is quite light and compact.,8
166,It has a major problem however,5
167,and that is,5
168,that it won't pick up anything on a carpet surface.,7
169,It dosen't produce much suction,7
170,which is probably the fault of an undersized motor.,7
171,It works a little better on hard surfaced floors but the design of the air discharge directly in the front the unit blows the dust away from the front of the cleaner head,5
172,making it a challange,5
173,to catch up with the dust bunnies.,5
174,I wouldn't waste the money on this cleaner,5
175,unless you enjoy going through the motions just for the arm exercise.,5
176,I gave the unit two stars,5
177,only because it has a nice automatic cord retractor.,3
178,Too bad,5
179,that they couldn't have provided a vacume cleaner,5
180,to go along with it.,5
181,"It won't pick up any lint on my area rug,",7
182,but it does a great job on the bare floors.,7
183,I need one,5
184,that does both carpet and floors,5
185,"(I don't have enough storage for both),",5
186,so I'm taking this one back.,5
187,I don't know,5
188,"why this is tagged as cordless,",5
189,it has a cord.,5
190,I bought this to clean my laminate wood floors.,5
191,I wanted something,5
192,"that wouldn't kill my back,",5
193,"was light weight,",8
194,and didn't tear up my floor.,5
195,This fits the bill.,5
196,It is not as powerful as my upright Hoover,7
197,but it's more convenient.,3
198,The cord retracts,3
199,which is nice.,3
200,It has onboard tools,0
201,and in a flash I can get into the corners and baseboards with the hose.,0
202,It picks up pretty good,7
203,but lint gets stuck on the little bottom wheels.,5
204,"Also, it is ESSENTIAL the filter be cleaned often otherwise it doesn't pick up well.",0
205,The filter is easy to clean ;,0
206,I just take it out back,5
207,and hose it off.,5
208,I paid $ 50 for it,6
209,and think,6
210,it's worth,6
211,it.,6
212,Just be sure,5
213,and clean the filter,0
214,and don't expect a regular vaccum in this little guy.,5
215,if you know,5
216,"what your doing,",5
217,this vacuum is awesome!,5
218,I need a small light weight vacuum for my hardwood floors.,8
219,"I am handycaped,",5
220,"and need something light and easy to maneuver,",8
221,"the retractable cord makes it so much easier,",3
222,and emptying it is a snap.,3
223,It is so lightweight,8
224,that I can even carry it myself.,8
225,I bought it to put in my RV,5
226,because it is easy to store in a small place,5
227,and the handle even breaks down.,5
228,The suction is very good.,7
229,I could not imagine anything,5
230,working better.,5
231,I am finally giving in,5
232,and buying a new one,5
233,and will be happy to trash this one!,5
234,From the beginning it would clog up on a regular basis,5
235,and I would have to disassemble the whole thing to find the clog.,3
236,"I can NOT get it to pick up at all on low carpets,",7
237,it just spits out the dirt.,5
238,It will not pick up anything,7
239,using just the hose.,7
240,THe latch,0
241,that holds it upright,5
242,"doesn't work,",5
243,the pet hair attachment never really worked.,0
244,It isn't the color of a lemon for nothing!,5
245,The vacuum has good suction,7
246,and the brush attachment works great.,0
247,The filter cover barley hangs on,0
248,and,5
249,"if you bump it,",0
250,it falls off easily.,0
251,When the canister is about half full dirt starts,0
252,to build up in the path from the filter,0
253,and the filter gets giant wads of dirt on it also.,0
254,"The spin duster does not really spin that great,",5
255,nor does it pick up much dust.,5
256,Overall I was,5
257,disappointed by this product,5
258,and will more than likely be returning it to the store,5
259,i bought it from,5
260,I wanted a new vaccuum,5
261,because my old one was heavy,5
262,and had a short on board hose.,5
263,"Well guess what, now I have another heavy vaccuum with a short hose.",8
264,I read negative reviews about this product,5
265,before I purchased it,5
266,but decided to ignore them,5
267,and purchase it,5
268,because the features looked impressive.,5
269,It is a powerful vaccum for the money but the spinning duster only `` spun '' maybe twice,6
270,so I just clean it the old fashioned way with the hose.,5
271,I purchased the only extension hose,0
272,that Eureka makes,0
273,and it is so long there is very little suction,0
274,so I just deal with the `` too-short '' hose.,5
275,I suggest Eureka skip the duster on their next model,5
276,and go for the longer hose,5
277,if you want to impress me!!!,5
278,I did give this product three stars though for cleaning ability.,7
279,"For the money, this vacuum is so much more than I expected.",6
280,It is lightweight,8
281,and has a lot of suction.,7
282,The only drawbacks,5
283,I have,5
284,are,5
285,that the accessories won't stay intact.,0
286,The air filter cover and extend want keep popping off,0
287,and falling off as well as the duster cap.,0
288,I have owned a lot of vacuums,5
289,"and by far, this is the best one for the money.",6
290,This product is excellent,5
291,and works exactly as it suggests.,5
292,The edge cleaning is better,5
293,than I have ever seen.,5
294,The telescopic duster is wonderful.,0
295,This product is the best of its kind.,5
296,The vacuum was used about 20 minutes per week but only lasted about 3 years before electrical connection in the swivel portions of the hose started to fail.,1
297,(We went through about 4 or 5 bags in the entire life of the vacuum.),0
298,"Pros : Was fairly quiet, good suction.",4
299,Cons : Very short life due to poor design/constuction of electronics.,1
300,Summary : Will never buy an Electrolux again.,5
301,"The canister is lightweight, quite powerful and reasonably quiet.",4
302,"BUT the power nozzle is heavy, noisy and turns in only one direction.",4
303,The power nozzle also is self-propelled,3
304,and takes the person vacuuming on a speed race around the carpet.,3
305,The floor brush is wide,0
306,and makes for quick cleaning of wide expanses of floor.,0
307,"BUT, it is so wide",0
308,as to be awkward getting into corners and around furniture.,0
309,The telescoping wand is convenient.,0
310,Storage of two of the tools on the handle is not ;,3
311,the tools keep falling off.,5
312,The power cord is short.,3
313,The hose is too flexible ;,3
314,it kinks easily.,3
315,I would prefer to have the on/off button on the handle of the cleaner not the cannister.,3
316,"I have had this not even a week,",5
317,and already I am disappointed in both the design and the materials,1
318,used in construction.,1
319,Added three days after the intial review :,5
320,The crevice brush is not long enough,0
321,"to reach in many common crevices, such as those in a car or under a refrigerator.",0
322,The prongs of the plug had to be separated a bit so the plug does not fall out of the wall socket.,5
323,I wanted a strong Vac,5
324,that is why I choose the canister electrolux.,5
325,Is very light weight and not very loud.,4
326,It does seem to shut down,5
327,while using it.,5
328,The attachments are ok,0
329,could be better.,0
330,While moving around the canister gets,3
331,stuck on the cord.,3
332,I wish,5
333,I had tryed it out in a store first even thou,5
334,it has so so power,7
335,it won't pick up the carpet pile very well.,7
336,I had inhouse Vac for years,5
337,then moved,5
338,and new house wasn't plumbed for in house,5
339,and was forced to buy Vac.,5
340,I will be buying another Vac but upright this time less worries of pulling a canister behind me I still give it a 3 star,5
341,but will have to give it a 0 for ease of using around house.,3
342,Vacuum is quiet,4
343,and performs well.,7
344,Removes dog hair from a rug,5
345,that 3 other vacs left in place.,5
346,Easy to carry.,3
347,"My only reservation is an excess of buttons and features - typical of all modern gadgets, not only this vac!",0
348,"Awesome vacuum, quiet as a mouse.",4
349,Does a great job on the carpet,7
350,and getting under and around things.,5
351,Replacement bags a little pricey but well worth it.,5
352,This is a very nice product!,5
353,I very much regret buying this vacuum.,5
354,It looses suction,7
355,when the vacuum bag is only half full,7
356,and the bags are not cheap.,6
357,But the worst thing about this vacuum is,3
358,that it will not roll behind me.,3
359,It flops onto its side,3
360,and I have to drag it around.,3
361,I contacted a Miele dealer,2
362,who said,5
363,it was a common problem,2
364,but they would not help me,2
365,because I purchased from Amazon.,2
366,I recently contacted Miele customer service,2
367,which is absolutely horrible!,2
368,It took multiple emails,2
369,before there was a response,5
370,and once they responded,2
371,they chose to ignore the issue of the vacuum falling on its side.,2
372,"It took two more emails to get this response "" Unfortunately",2
373,it has,5
374,been recognized,5
375,that this can be an issue.,5
376,"There is no fix for this. """,5
377,"After using a Kirby vacuum system for several years,",5
378,we were ready to try something lighter and less complicated.,5
379,"After trying the Miele,",5
380,I am not satisfied for a few reasons :,5
381,1,5
382,The power cord is too short.,3
383,I even have to replug the vacuum,5
384,in when I'm half way down the stairs.,5
385,2,5
386,"When using the vacuum on hard floors,",5
387,some of the dirt/sand gets pushed to the edge of the wall,5
388,and this vacuum does not have enough suction,7
389,to get the dirt,5
390,that is on the edge or corners of the floors.,5
391,"I have to use a separate attachment,",5
392,which means vacuuming takes me twice as long!,3
393,3,5
394,The bags are small.,0
395,"They fill up quickly,",0
396,and they are expensive.,6
397,"It is quiet and light weight,",4
398,but I feel,5
399,that it just doesn't cut it,5
400,when it comes to cleaning.,5
401,I didn't have any of these issues with my Kirby.,5
402,"I will be returning this item,",5
403,and looking for a new Kirby.,5
404,Bought this product,5
405,after my Kenmore finally conked out.,5
406,The suction is good as well as the filtering of the air...,7
407,"but because there are only three wheels,",5
408,it is constantly falling over.,3
409,The air exhaust,5
410,is on the top of the canister and blows up.,5
411,This is annoying,5
412,if you stand over the canister.,5
413,The cord is much shorter,3
414,than my Kenmore was,5
415,so you have to constantly replug it in.,3
416,The ring,5
417,that holds the tools around the hose,5
418,gets stuck with the hose,5
419,when you rotate it.,5
420,And the rug beater doesn't do shag,0
421,(of which I have several shag rugs).,5
422,I've had Electrolux and Kenmore vacuums,5
423,and would say,5
424,they were much consumer friendly.,5
425,I really like the suction of this vacuum.,7
426,The carpet cleaning tool is hard to push,3
427,unless you turn the suction back.,5
428,"I would rate it 5 star,",5
429,but the brush for hardwood floors is a little too big.,0
430,It is awkward,3
431,trying to get in close places and corners.,3
432,"This vacuum is light, quiet, and powerful.",4
433,Blows away all of the Kenmore vacuums,5
434,we've owned in the past.,5
435,One slight detractor is,5
436,that there's no on-board storage for the parquet floor attachment,0
437,as there is for the other attachments.,0
438,But I figured out,5
439,that it can hang on the back next to the power cord on the clip,5
440,that supposed,5
441,to hold the power head.,5
442,But this broke after only one use.,1
443,It simply quit working.,1
444,"It seemed great,",5
445,but while cleaning the house the first time,1
446,"using the vacuum,",1
447,"it burnt out,",1
448,"and we have an average household with some dog hair,",5
449,that had been cleaned only two weeks prior.,5
450,"Probably just a bad unit, but can not recommend regardless.",5
451,Missing hose extension and smelled of something burning,0
452,when turn on.,1
453,A Hoover representative told me,2
454,that the smell was from a lubricate,2
455,and would dissipate with after time.,2
456,Still waiting,2
457,I wont have this vacuum,5
458,to clean the floor at home,5
459,"it is not enough power,",7
460,but I bought it for a ceramic floor and it's ok.,7
461,I will like it better,5
462,if Hoover make the wireless version. : -),5
463,Hoover Handheld Canister Vacuum - SH10010,5
464,This is a great vacuum.,5
465,The suction is superb ;,7
466,it picks up the dirt in my tile's grout lines,7
467,that my old Ergorapido used to leave behind.,7
468,"Unfortunately, the HEPA filter is small.",0
469,"It requires lots of emptying, or, potentially, lots of replacing.",0
470,If I were to discard and replace the filter,0
471,"after it filled up,",0
472,this would be an expensive system.,0
473,"As it is,",5
474,"I don't have allergies,",5
475,so I just take the filter to the garbage can outside,0
476,and shake it out.,0
477,This has saved me from having to buy new filters every week or so.,5
478,I realize,5
479,not everyone can empty dusty filters the way,5
480,"I do,",5
481,but this has been a money-saver for us.,5
482,"I would recommend this vacuum to anyone,",5
483,"as it is lightweight, easy to store, and performs well.",3
484,Love this! gave my sister one,5
485,too her apt is tiny,5
486,and this is really a mighty mini.,3
487,A pleasure,5
488,"to throw away the dirt,",5
489,bags are big and easy to get on amazon.,5
490,Will never have a bagless vac again.,5
491,I also have the upright and love that too. worth every penny.,5
492,My wife purchased this vacuum from Amazon less then two weeks ago,5
493,and it is already having major problems.,1
494,The vacuum overheats,1
495,and shuts itself off after less then 5 minutes.,1
496,The motor sounds,4
497,like it is ready to explode.,4
498,"We have checked for any clogs, jams etc..",5
499,It is just poorly built.,1
500,"If we had not already tossed the box,",5
501,this would be going back.,5
502,I expected alot more from Panasonic.,5
503,We have the older version of this vacuum.,5
504,It was purchased because of it's light weight and our past history with Panasonic vacuums.,8
505,The bottom line is not impressed.,5
506,In not so high pile carpet the beater brush just bogs down makes the unit almost impossible to push forward.,3
507,Other complaints :,5
508,the hose is way too short,0
509,and where the hose attaches pops out unannounced.,0
510,So you are happily sweeping,5
511,and the dirt is being blown back into the room.,5
512,I would never buy another Panasonic,5
513,without a trial period and the ability,5
514,to return it.,5
515,Just not up to the standards of the old Panasonic bag sweepers.,5
516,BEWARE!,5
517,This is little vacuum works absolutely terrific on low pile carpet and even bare tile floors!,5
518,"However,",5
519,"unlike what it claims to,",5
520,it will not adjust to different carpet pile heights.,3
521,It bogs down on higher pile carpet,1
522,and doesn't do a good job.,1
523,It's almost impossible to vacuum it at all.,3
524,I really didn't discover this,5
525,until after I had it for more than 30 days,5
526,or I would have returned it.,5
527,"If the one I have is defective,",5
528,I'm open to exchanging it for an properly operational one.,5
529,Hope the seller sees this!,5
530,I'm very disappointed.,5
531,This is my first bagless vacuum.,5
532,I bought it,5
533,"after viewing a very helpful video,",5
534,and thought,5
535,it would be perfect for a small apartment.,5
536,"It was easy to assemble,",3
537,and I used it immediately.,3
538,"So far, I like it",5
539,because I can see how much dust it picks up,7
540,and it's so easy,3
541,to empty the canister.,3
542,Just a minor drawback for me is its weight.,8
543,"It's supposed to be light weight,",8
544,and I guess,8
545,that's probably so.,8
546,"For me, however, just a little heavier than I thought.",8
547,"But maneuvering is easy,",3
548,"and as I use it more,",5
549,I probably won't feel it that heavy.,8
550,This is one of if not my favorite vacuum cleaners!,5
551,First off considering the size,8
552,"(full size vacuum),",8
553,this one is lightweight!,8
554,"It's not silent,",4
555,"but compare it with others of this size,",4
556,and it's much more quiet.,4
557,And the weight.,8
558,Very light compared to other others of this size.,8
559,Cord rolls inside the vacuum,0
560,so that you don't have to roll it up on the back of the cleaner,0
561,"(where the cord falls down, etc.).",3
562,Personally I like this.,5
563,Nice and neat.,5
564,Suction power is excellent!,7
565,This gets down into the thick plush rugs.,7
566,"Really picks up dirt, grind, hair, etc..",7
567,Comes with your standard attachments.,0
568,Nothing special there.,5
569,Keep in mind it's a `` bagless '' vacuum.,5
570,"So when you empty it,",5
571,you are,5
572,gon na want to go outside,3
573,"as when you empty it,",3
574,most likely it will give off a dust cloud,3
575,"(if you are not very, very careful).",5
576,Panasonic has a winner here.,5
577,"This is my second Samsung vacuum,",5
578,"The fist one was the Robotic,",5
579,Cost me $ 599.,5
580,"Let along it didn't do the job,",5
581,but it broke after 3 months.,5
582,Samsung refused to repair,5
583,and turned me around.,5
584,But let's talk about this one.,5
585,It has absolutely no suction power.,7
586,"When you use the power brush,",0
587,"it's more or less OK,",0
588,but without it there is absolutely NO SUCTION.,0
589,The dust bag and all snappers are so flimsy,0
590,and can be broke so easily.,0
591,The vacuum stop,1
592,working couple of times due to it,1
593,was overheated.,1
594,So I had to wait 15 minutes or so to resume vacuuming.,5
595,I would not recommend this Vacuum to anyone.,5
596,Had this vacuum for 2 months and the plastic upper wand broke,1
597,as I was vacuuming.,5
598,Spent over an hour on the phone with customer service,2
599,just to find out,2
600,that they would have the service department contact me within 3 business days.,2
601,Very frustrating!!!,5
602,Vacuum worked fine up until this point.,5
603,Very disappointed!,5
604,Consumer reports gave this a good rating,5
605,and it does a good job cleaning,5
606,but there are a couple of things,5
607,that could have been better.,5
608,The most annoying problem is,5
609,that the attachments do not fit on the unit,0
610,so you can't conveniently switch them.,0
611,"Also,",5
612,to remove hair and string,3
613,that gets wrapped around the rollers,3
614,you have to remove several screws,3
615,to take off the plate in order,3
616,to get to the rollers.,3
617,One other thing,5
618,that is a nuisance is,5
619,"that there are 2 power buttons, one on the handle and one on the canister,",5
620,sometimes the one on the handle does not work,5
621,so I have to use the button on the unit.,5
622,I have had the vacuum cleaner for only a couple of months,5
623,so I am hoping,5
624,that the power button on the canister doesn't start having glitches too.,5
625,It seems,5
626,like it is getting difficult to find good canister vacuums nowadays.,5
627,This one is about as good,5
628,as they come.,5
629,I agree with others,5
630,that it should have an indicator,5
631,showing,5
632,if you are,5
633,"running the Low, Med, or high speed on the brush.",5
634,You can normally tell by the sound,5
635,but it isn't always easy.,5
636,Love the bagless design and good performance.,5
637,It is hard to please my wife,5
638,"and this one made her happy,",5
639,so that is a big plus.,5
640,0,5
641,I love this vacuum!,5
642,"It's powerful and quiet, stylish and functional.",4
643,I love,0
644,that it came with a hardwood attachment.,0
645,The power brush is amazing.,0
646,I have two cats,5
647,so it is extremely nice,5
648,that it filters the dander out of the air,0
649,while you vacuum.,5
650,I highly recommend this vacuum over the higher priced versions.,5
651,I bought this vacuum cleaner from Best Buy in December,5
652,after ordering and returning a $ 519 Dyson Animal vacuum cleaner,5
653,that arrived with a sheared off wheel.,5
654,(Dyson is made entirely of plastic).,5
655,"This Hoover is great on my wood floors,",5
656,"the hose is easy to whip out and use,",3
657,and the vacuum is lightweight and maneuvers nicely.,8
658,"On the downside,",5
659,it doesn't suck well on carpets,7
660,and the brush roll turns itself off after a pass or two on the carpet.,0
661,These problems i dealt with.,5
662,"However, one day recently the brush roll button wouldn't turn on the brush roll.",0
663,"I looked at the Hoover self help videos,",2
664,but they were useless.,2
665,I think,1
666,it is an electrical issue.,1
667,I've taken the vacuum cleaner apart,5
668,"and there are no obstructions,",5
669,"the belt looks fine, and so on.",5
670,Technically it is still under warranty,5
671,but I didn't keep my Best Buy receipt,5
672,so we registered it late and still haven't gotten a warranty card in the mail.,2
673,What a waste of $ 200.,6
674,I'm very disappointed.,5
675,This vacuum cleaner seemed so great at first.,5
676,It's very light and compact.,8
677,It has good suction,7
678,"for cleaning hard floors,",7
679,which is mostly,5
680,what I'm interested in.,5
681,The way the attachments work is very clever and efficient.,0
682,I also like the way you can easily turn on or off the brush roller,0
683,if you need,5
684,to clean both hard floors and carpet.,5
685,"All that is great,",5
686,"but after using it only a few times,",1
687,the brush roller would not turn on anymore.,1
688,"I tried cleaning the brush,",5
689,which wasn't fouled or dirty,5
690,because I've hardly,5
691,used it.,5
692,Still it will not turn on.,1
693,I read some of the reviews here on Amazon,5
694,and I saw,5
695,that a lot of other people have,5
696,run into the same problem with the brush roller not turning on,1
697,and they have not had much luck,5
698,with fixing it.,5
699,So you can buy this vacuum,5
700,"if you like the features,",5
701,but be prepared for the brush roller,1
702,to stop working after a short period.,1
703,Cleans great,5
704,"but it's heavy and hard to push, especially on large area rugs",8
705,that have a solid backing.,5
706,It seems to suck down,3
707,and be difficult to move.,3
708,We have two small dogs,5
709,and it does a really good job,7
710,of picking up the dog hair.,7
711,We also have hardwoods with area rugs.,5
712,It cleans,5
713,both well but is a little more work on the area rugs,3
714,than I'd like.,3
715,On the second floor we have wall-to-wall carpet,3
716,and it is not as difficult to push.,3
717,All in all its OK.,5
718,If you don't have any dense area rugs,5
719,it might be rated higher.,5
720,Very good vacuum for the price.,6
721,No need to spend your money on the pricey Dyson.,6
722,"We had a Dyson before,",5
723,and I feel its very overpriced.,5
724,The Wind Tunnel does,5
725,exactly what the Dyson can do.,5
726,The suction on this vacuum is very strong.,7
727,I vacuum everyday and so far I think its great.,5
728,Vacuuming on hard floors works very well too.,3
729,"Its well built,",1
730,sturdy but easy to manuever.,1
731,Some cons :,5
732,The cord is very short.,0
733,"Also,",5
734,emptying the canister requires both hands.,0
735,Dust will get all over your hands.,5
736,Switching to use,3
737,the hose is messy,0
738,as it involves flipping up a flap,3
739,"where the dust goes through,",3
740,dust falls to floor in that area.,5
741,I would recommend this.,5
742,You can get 2 of these for 1 Dyson.,5
743,This vacuum is amazing!,5
744,Effortless manuevering with the twist of a wrist.,3
745,The hose/handle attachment is great for getting to hard to reach places.,0
746,Extremely powerful suction picked up anything in it's way.,7
747,Emptying the canister is as easy,3
748,as pressing a button.,3
749,"The filtration system is wonderful,",0
750,helping with our indoor allergies.,0

0,The keyboard is inexpensive and probably fine,8
1,unless you are a touch typist.,7
2,"Then it has a few quite annoying quirks, such as backspace key",4
3,"is too small,",4
4,and the set of Insert/Delete/Home / End/PageUp/PageDown has an extra row of keys on a top.,4
5,Somehow it gets quite annoying,3
6,when you type fast and type a lot.,3
7,"So,",7
8,"after using this keyboard for about a week,",7
9,I'll be returning it back.,7
10,I'll be getting Dell USB keyboard instead.,7
11,This keyboard is perfect,7
12,if you hammer away for hours on end,7
13,and are looking for something stiff and sturdy,0
14,that feels like it will last for years.,0
15,"I, on the other hand, find it to be too stiff.",3
16,"It's an plain-looking, solidly-built thing,",5
17,"and I will keep it as a back-up,",7
18,but this won't be a daily-use keyboard for me.,7
19,It simply requires too much effort,3
20,to press each key.,3
21,If you do a lot of typing this keyboard's layout,4
22,can become frustrating.,4
23,"The backspace key is really small,",4
24,and the insert/delete / home/end,4
25,/ etc. cluster is one row lower than usual.,4
26,"Also, the spacebar does squeak slightly as the other reviewer mentioned.",6
27,But,7
28,if you don't mind the layout,4
29,"and aren't going to be typing 8 hours a day,",7
30,then you'll probably have no complaints.,7
31,"When my computer started randomly ignoring keystrokes on my old OEM multimedia keyboard,",7
32,I decided to get this Kensington Keyboard for Life,7
33,"to replace it due to it having a number pad but still being a smaller form-factor than the old keyboard,",4
34,leaving more room on the keyboard tray for mouse and mouse pad.,4
35,I've been very pleased with the product,7
36,and it seems to not only work well,7
37,"but "" feel "" well, too.",3
38,"Good construction,",0
39,and truly anticipate it having a very long life.,0
40,This is a really surprising find!.. a computer keyboard,7
41,that is not all plastic.. actually,0
42,has weight to it...,0
43,does not move around when you type.. and stays cleaner than my last 70. 00 microsoft keyboard.,7
44,This is a very affordable keyboard,8
45,that will provide you with many hours of dependability...,7
46,BUY IT!,7
47,"I purchased a Microsoft Wired PS/2 Keyboard from Amazon.com one month ago,",7
48,to replace two previous keyboards,7
49,(another brand),7
50,which were unsatisfactory due to fading or chipping of the letters from the most frequently used keys.,7
51,I presumed,7
52,that a `` name brand '',7
53,(Microsoft) keyboard,7
54,"would be of superior quality,",7
55,giving me longer service.,7
56,I was wrong.,7
57,"My previous `` generic brand '' keyboards lasted 6 to 8 months each,",7
58,before certain frequently used,7
59,letters disappeared from the keys.,7
60,"My Microsoft PS/2 keyboard had been in service just one month,",0
61,and 5 or 6 frequently used,0
62,letters are already faded to the extent,0
63,that they are likely to disappear completely in another month.,0
64,I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the Microsoft keyboard,0
65,I recently purchased from Amazon.com.,7
66,"A cheaply-made, flimsy keyboard.",0
67,This keyboard -,7
68,although it is functional -,7
69,is not worth the fifteen bucks.,8
70,It's a 7 or 8 dollar keyboard,8
71,"that,",7
72,"because of its branding,",7
73,is selling for double its worth.,7
74,Microsoft hardware used to be consistently better than average.,7
75,Not anymore.,7
76,I have this at work,7
77,"and it's ok, but not great.",7
78,Either I can't type quietly,6
79,or it is not a quiet keyboard ;,6
80,"either way, I'm looking for a replacement",7
81,and hope this issue will disappear.,7
82,Do not purchase,6
83,if looking for a quiet keyboard.,6
84,This keyboard is a very good value.,8
85,"It has only a PS2 connection, so",1
86,if you need to use USB,1
87,you will need a converter plug.,1
88,"I needed a PS2,",7
89,so it was OK for me.,7
90,"Also,",7
91,I deducted one star,7
92,because the cord,7
93,for connecting to the computer is a little shorter than the one,7
94,"I had,",7
95,"but if your computer isn't too far from your keyboard,",7
96,you'll be ok.,7
97,Keys are quiet,6
98,and require minimal pressure.,3
99,Has a top row of quick link,2
100,"keys including Favorites, Mail, Homepage and Music and others.",2
101,"Nothing fancy,",7
102,"but if you need a simple, quiet keyboard",6
103,this one will work well for you.,7
104,I love this keyboard.,7
105,"It's cheap, simple, and smooth.",3
106,My only problem,7
107,I had with it,7
108,"was getting used to the new positioning of the Home, Insert, Delete, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys",4
109,since they are at a perpendicular,4
110,angle that of most other keyboards.,4
111,"It's a great keyboard,",7
112,but may take some time,7
113,getting used for certain tasks.,7
114,What can I say?,7
115,"I love Macally normally,",7
116,but someone botched the job here.,7
117,Keyboard arrived with numerous letters popped out of the case.,0
118,I had to pop them back in.,0
119,"Once I reassembled it,",7
120,I boxed it back up as a gift.,7
121,"My recipient got it,",7
122,hooked it up,7
123,and found the P key to not be working.,0
124,"Ironically, the P key wasn't one of the many keys",0
125,that had popped off.,0
126,"Additionally, my friend's USB 2. 0 webcam won't work with the keyboard",1
127,yet works fine in other ports,1
128,so it's not the webcam,1
129,he uses,7
130,that is the problem.,7
131,I'm very disappointed,7
132,because the features of this keyboard were just,7
133,what was wanted.,7
134,It has 2 USB 2. 0 ports,2
135,but useless if a 2. 0 device plugs into one?,2
136,"Maybe it's a low-voltage USB hub in there,",7
137,"but if so,",7
138,packaging should state that clearly somewhere.,7
139,I bought three of this keyboards.,7
140,"I like the finger feeling, quiet and soft.",3
141,The biggest problem :,7
142,it does not last long.,0
143,"After a few months of usage, for example, the cmd + copy starts to work badly.",0
144,"If you want to have a keyboard for a short period of time,",7
145,this one will serve you well.,7
146,I myself am,7
147,looking for a better solution.,7
148,"I may try the latest apple one,",7
149,and see how it performs.,7
150,"Yes, it looks and feels cheap",3
151,"and it's noisy to type on,",6
152,but for $ 20 it gets the job done.,8
153,Does it bother me as an apple geek?,7
154,You bet,7
155,it does!,7
156,If you just need an extra keyboard,7
157,go for it.,7
158,But,7
159,if style matters then spend the money,5
160,and get an apple keyboard.,7
161,Or another one.,7
162,Whatever.,7
163,I just didn't need to spend $ 50 -,7
164,$ 70 on an extra keyboard.,7
165,Which is what this will be someday.,7
166,This is a very nice keyboard for the price.,8
167,"It is a bit loud,",6
168,but not the loudest I have heard.,6
169,"The keys have a loose feel,",3
170,"but it has all the buttons to interface with my iMac,",1
171,and has 2 USB 2. 0 ports.,1
172,"Power button,",2
173,and keypad.,7
174,Beats the new flat iMac keyboard for feel.,3
175,"It can be angled/raised at back,",2
176,and has volume controls.,2
177,"Not the highest quality keyboard, but good in features,",2
178,"large sized keys, easy to type with responsive smooth keys to the touch, with a slight dip in each key.",3
179,Has a spot for a pen or pencil,2
180,to lay at top of keyboard.,2
181,I recommend for those,7
182,who wish to save money,7
183,yet need a Mac keyboard!,7
184,I must've bought at least five of them over the years.,7
185,Not that they don't last -,7
186,they've gone with systems I've either sold or gifted to people.,7
187,"This has a short, laptop-style keystroke,",3
188,which gives much more positive feedback than the current Apple keyboards.,3
189,"For me, that means fast, accurate typing.",3
190,"The control/option/cmd keys are in the right place, Hooray!",4
191,"Price of entry is way below the current Apple keyboard,",8
192,and this is orders of magnitude better than the old white Apple Pro keyboards or any of the awful USB keyboards,0
193,that came before it.,7
194,"Beware that it does have a rather large footprint,",5
195,although the design is attractive,5
196,and doesn't look out of place with the other Apple junk on my desk.,5
197,This keyboard is beautiful and sleek,5
198,and feels awesome,3
199,when typing.,3
200,Unfortunately it has many keys,0
201,that don't work.,0
202,Just google it,7
203,and look on the Logitech forums.,7
204,You will see that the same keys aren't working for all these people.,0
205,I bought one,0
206,and it malfunctioned right out of the box.,0
207,Returned and got a second one with the same problem.,0
208,Finally got one,7
209,that did work.,7
210,Wold be a great keyboard,7
211,if it worked.,7
212,Ordered a `` brand new '',7
213,(not a refurb),7
214,Logitech dinovo keyboard for notebooks.,7
215,Took a while to ship.,7
216,"When I opened up the Amazon box,",7
217,the logitech box inside had already been opened...,7
218,I was thinking maybe it came open while,7
219,being shipped.,7
220,Nope.,7
221,It had small scratches,7
222,that looked like whom ever opened,7
223,it had tried,7
224,to clean it,7
225,and left little swirly scratches on the piano black portion in between the num pad and keyboard.,7
226,I still would have looked past all that,7
227,"and been happy to have kept it,",7
228,"but the F, L and q keys don't work at all.",0
229,I didnt check the num pad or any of the other keys.,7
230,I finally realized,0
231,that those keys were dead,0
232,after trying to troubleshoot it on logitech's site.,7
233,I am pretty disappointed Cause,7
234,I really liked the look of it : (,5
235,I really like the diNovo keyboards.,7
236,They are well contructed,0
237,and have high-quality scissor keys.,0
238,The battery life is measured in years.,7
239,The USB connection is tiny.,1
240,This keyboard will work with or without the SetPoint software loaded.,1
241,I didn't bother to configure the function keys,2
242,so they're pretty much useless.,2
243,"By design, the Eject key is just over the Backspace key",4
244,and I hit it by accident all of the time.,4
245,My DVD is open,7
246,as I write this.,7
247,You couldn't put the Eject key in a worse place,4
248,if you tried.,4
249,What were they thinking?,7
250,And who needs a dedicated key,7
251,to eject a DVD?,7
252,My IBM keyboard worked,7
253,my email word processor etc. out of the box,7
254,once I installed the driver.,7
255,I don't have the time,7
256,to waste setting up this keyboard's function keys.,2
257,You would think,7
258,that Logitech could default the function keys to - call me crazy -,7
259,"Microsoft Office, Windows Media Player, Internet Explorer, etc..",7
260,"No, it's much better",7
261,to default to nothing,7
262,and make every end-user setup the function keys manually.,7
263,This keyboard is great.,7
264,"I purchased it on 8/24/09,",7
265,and have lately began to see intermittent radio problems.,1
266,PRO's :,7
267,The combination of black gloss plastic,5
268,and aluminum give it a very high quality look and feel.,3
269,Its short vertical button travel allows for minimal easy transition from laptop to this keyboard,3
270,as the two feel very similar.,7
271,"For fifty bucks, its was a great deal.",8
272,CON's :,7
273,"After 3 years of good use, the keyboard looses connection with the dongle 2-3 times per week.",1
274,I like everything about this keyboard.,7
275,Most of keyboards today have a lot of useless keys,7
276,that only occupies,7
277,the real estate space,7
278,making space and control keys,7
279,"crammed,",7
280,but this one is simple and clean.,7
281,The keyboard looks slim and sexy.,5
282,"I am using it for desktop PC, don't know",7
283,why they are emphasizing as for notebook though.,7
284,You won't regret it!,7
285,Cons : Tiny delete key,4
286,located in awkward top-row placing.,4
287,Letters began wearing off within four months.,0
288,"Died within one year,",0
289,replacing batteries did not bring it back to life.,0
290,"Pros : good key spring, nice size.",3
291,The keyboard is nice however after about a week of using the keyboard,7
292,I noticed,3
293,that the board was causing my right wrist to hurt.,3
294,Switching to a different keyboard,7
295,that could be angled properly,7
296,(the K340 does not have any feet,3
297,for angling the keyboard up),3
298,my wrist stopped hurting.,7
299,As I said,7
300,the keyboard is compact and the keys feel,3
301,great to type on.,3
302,"Tied with my M505 Marathon Mouse this makes a really great portable setup for work,",7
303,but the lack of angling and the subsequent pain has been a deal breaker.,3
304,this was a nice keyboard for its time with me.,7
305,As I write this review this keyboard has,7
306,been recently replaced.,7
307,It worked well but,7
308,as time went on the mechanical springs began to give,0
309,and it tended to accumulate dirt,0
310,and cause sticking keys. this is all normal for a keyboard so more an observation than a complaint.,3
311,It was my first wireless keyboard,7
312,and I believe overall it was a good purchase.,7
313,It lasted several years in fact,0
314,and used nearly 20 hours a day most every day.,0
315,"This is a basic keyboard,",7
316,but it works well,7
317,and is pretty comfortable for me to use.,3
318,"I type all day long on it,",7
319,and I haven't had any problems.,7
320,It works perfectly with the unified receiver,1
321,"that I use for my Logitech mouse,",1
322,so I only need one receiver in my computer for both devices.,1
323,Some people have complained about not having the ability,7
324,"to tilt the keyboard,",7
325,but I haven't found,3
326,that to be a problem for me -,3
327,it's still pretty comfortable to use.,3
328,All together I am very pleased with this keyboard.,7
329,My fingers glide over the keys.,3
330,I love the feel of this keyboard.,3
331,"It is very responsive,",3
332,and it looks great too.,5
333,For use with a PC,7
334,"running Windows,",7
335,it's great!,7
336,I highly recommend it!,7
337,"For a Mac, it's not quite as good",7
338,because of the location and size of the `` option '' and `` command '' keys,4
339,compared to Apple keyboards.,7
340,"As a long-time Mac user, I make extensive use of keyboard shortcuts,",7
341,almost all of which require the `` command '' key.,7
342,"On Apple keyboards, the `` command '' key is located to the immediate left of the space bar",7
343,and is larger than regular keys.,7
344,I use my left thumb on that key to type keyboard shortcuts.,7
345,"Alas, on this keyboard, the `` command '' key is the Windows key,",4
346,which is the second key to the left of the space bar.,4
347,"The key to the immediate left of the space bar is the ALT key,",4
348,which on a Mac is the `` option '' key.,4
349,"Also, it is not as large as the `` command '' key on an Apple keyboard.",4
350,"As trivial as that reason may seem,",7
351,it really slows me down,7
352,"and for that reason alone,",7
353,I would not purchase this keyboard for a Mac.,7
354,This is a compact keyboard,4
355,and the key layout is very poor.,4
356,The keys themselves do not press down well.,3
357,"If you press one key then the key next to it,",0
358,it gets caught,0
359,and doesnt depress at times,0
360,causing typos.,7
361,The home key next to a half sized,4
362,backspace key is a total nuiscance.,4
363,When you think,4
364,you backspaced you actually hit the home key,4
365,sending your cursor to the beginning of the line.,7
366,The company,7
367,"I bought this from was excellent, very responsive to me emails.",7
368,"I would definately do business with them again, just not on this product.",7
369,"Size does matter,",7
370,when you're a touch typist.,7
371,"Unfortunately, this isn't a full size keyboard, and --",4
372,although the size variance isn't huge --,4
373,many of the keys,4
374,aren't where they belong on a standard keyboard.,4
375,I purchased the Logitech white illuminated,7
376,and have been far happier.,7
377,I don't really feel the need,7
378,to criticize the keyboard,7
379,"since it is,",7
380,"and does, everything",7
381,"the manufacturers say,",7
382,but I'm back to Amazon today,7
383,to buy a different lighted keyboard,7
384,and I'll keep this one for emergencies.,7
385,"First, the positives.",7
386,The keyboard is sleek and visually appealing.,5
387,I love the blue back-lighting.,2
388,It would probably be a good keyboard,7
389,"to take along for use with a laptop,",7
390,and that may have been the intent,7
391,because the condensed keyboard is laid out like a laptop keyboard.,4
392,"That, unfortunately, is also part of the problem.",4
393,"The layout of the keys makes it difficult for me to use, with keys like the backspace,",4
394,"which I use a lot,",4
395,"surrounded by other small keys such as Home & End,",4
396,which sends your cursor all over the page,7
397,when you hit them by mistake.,7
398,It's probably not the best keyboard for people,7
399,who do a lot of typing.,7
400,"In fact, I plugged in my old keyboard",7
401,to write this review.,7
402,"For the price, I am not displeased,",8
403,and it will be a good standby in case,7
404,"I need it,",7
405,"but for long-term use, a different keyboard is probably a better choice.",7
406,I love this keyboard &,7
407,if I had to complain about anything at all,7
408,it would just be,7
409,that the keys are pretty loud,6
410,when pressed & it needs a longer cord.,1
411,"The keys I can't do anything about,",7
412,but the cord length was easy.,7
413,I bought a USB extension & problem solved.,7
414,The back light is very bright yet easy on your eyes.,2
415,I use this keyboard with my PS3 slim,7
416,& Fatty & it works perfectly.,7
417,I have had this item for several months now.,7
418,It is THE BEST keyboard,7
419,I have ever owned.,7
420,I really like the way the keyboad is illuminated.,2
421,Best investment in keyboards around Haven't had a single problem with it.,7
422,"I bought this for a customer,",7
423,and,7
424,"when I plugged it in,",7
425,the PC acted,0
426,"like the Control key was constantly pressed,",0
427,so I couldn't type the letter f,7
428,without causing a search,7
429,to start on the PC.,7
430,The keyboard also feels flimsy,3
431,when typing on it.,3
432,"If you want a backlit keyboard,",2
433,I recommend spending a bit more money,7
434,and getting the Logitech Gaming Keyboard G105.,7
435,This keyboard looks very sleek,5
436,and I love the lit keys.,2
437,"But the arrangement of this keyboard is absolutely awful,",4
438,which pretty severely reduces its usability.,3
439,"This is NOT a "" full sized "" standard keyboard.",4
440,The keys are smaller,4
441,and the keyboard is compressed.,4
442,The half-sized delete key with the Home button right next to it is particularly egregious.,4
443,I've had this keyboard for well over a year now,7
444,and even though I spend many hours a day,7
445,"using it,",7
446,I'm still not used to it,7
447,(I've had,7
448,to make multiple corrections on this review).,7
449,I'm basically fed up,7
450,and will be buying a replacement soon.,7
451,The illumination of the keys is perfect.,2
452,They're not too bright or too dim.,2
453,The blue color of the illumination is beautiful as well.,2
454,I can use this keyboard in a dark room.,2
455,It is a little smaller than other keyboards but not significanly so.,4
456,I didn't find,7
457,it's smaller size,4
458,to be uncomfortable or inconvenient.,3
459,"On the downside, the keys are noisy, giggly,",6
460,and feel cheap.,3
461,So I gave it three out of five stars.,7
462,The keys are a little clackety for my taste,3
463,but then again I don't do a whole lot,7
464,of typing on it anyway.,7
465,The keys are backlit in a soft blue,2
466,that isn't too overwhelming.,2
467,It does have a button,2
468,to turn the backlight function off,2
469,but if you do,7
470,that you won't be able to see the lettering on the keys at all.,7
471,It has a variety of other useful function buttons,2
472,including volume buttons for the sound.,2
473,The only thing,7
474,I don't like about this keyboard,4
475,is the enter key,4
476,is a little smaller than on most boards,4
477,"and the backspace key is very small, the same size as the letter keys.",4
478,"Other than that, I like",7
479,it ok.,7
480,Great product at a good price.,8
481,Works as described.,7
482,I would recommend it to anyone,7
483,looking for a product such as this.,7
484,The blue lit keyboard is the best looking,2
485,that I have seen.,7
486,This keyboard was very nice looking,5
487,and worked well at first.,7
488,I found out,7
489,that there is no cut off switch,2
490,and the keyboard does,2
491,not auto shut off,2
492,so the battery does not last more than one day.,7
493,I ended up,7
494,throwing it away,7
495,and getting a totally different keyboard.,7
496,I like the size of this keyboard.,5
497,But it went to sleep too much,2
498,to save battery.,2
499,It got to be annoying to wake it up in the middle,2
500,of reading an article.,2
501,"Also, too much lag",1
502,if you type fast.,1
503,I sold it,7
504,and got a hard-wired Apple keyboard,7
505,"that is no longer made,",7
506,but still can be found online.,7
507,"It's a good enough product,",7
508,I should say.,7
509,"Sleek looking,",5
510,"flat buttons,",5
511,I like it.,7
512,Just few minor problems.,7
513,It loses its connection sometimes,1
514,and it causes a little delay.,1
515,"Also, I get double with one click sometimes.",7
516,"For example,",7
517,"if I type ` have ',",7
518,it shows as ` havee '.,7
519,It's not me,7
520,who is doing it!,7
521,"But overall, I'm satisfied.",7
522,This might not be the one for heavy user.,7
523,I use this keyboard,7
524,when my mac is hooked up to my TV,7
525,so I can surf the web in bed.,7
526,They keyboard works great and syncs up quickly.,1
527,The only thing,7
528,I'd have to warn people about is,7
529,that the keys are a bit stiff.,3
530,Hard to the touch.,3
531,"Nothing like the keys on my mac,",3
532,so it takes a little,7
533,getting used to.,7
534,"I wouldn't say its a bad thing, or a deal breaker in any way,",7
535,but it does loose a few points in that area.,7
536,This a very nice product.,7
537,"True, the case is plastic.",5
538,But the front panel is aluminum.,5
539,The keys are smooth,3
540,"and feel like rubber, the same as the Apple keyboard.",3
541,They click nicely.,3
542,"Side by side with the Apple keyboard,",7
543,you can see the characters on the Azio keys are printed in boldface.,7
544,They are much more legible.,7
545,"Otherwise, I can barely tell one from the other.",7
546,What are you other reviewers smoking?,7
547,The keyboard itself has good reactivity,3
548,and is light and portable.,3
549,"However, I am very, very disappointed in the durability of this product.",0
550,I have owned it for less than two months,0
551,and the key for the `` t '' is already broken.,0
552,I have to afix back to the keyboard now every time I go to type.,0
553,"I have been gently using this keyboard,",0
554,"transporting it in a heavy leather briefcase,",7
555,so this is rather poor craftsmanship.,0
556,I have noted,7
557,that the return policy has convieniently expired at the end of April,7
558,(two weeks after I am writing this review).,7
559,I will have to pursue the warranty at Microsoft,7
560,now unless someone reasonable from Amazon reads this,7
561,(crossing my fingers here).,7
562,Bottom line :,7
563,avoid this product due to durability issues.,0
564,"I've tried a few of these keyboards,",7
565,and they all have constant connection problems.,1
566,"The layout is nice,",4
567,and the action is ok.,3
568,Good for typing,3
569,if it could stay,1
570,connected.,1
571,All 3,1
572,I've tried,1
573,have connection problems with multiple computers,1
574,while 4 other bluetooth keyboards have never had similar connection problems.,7
575,The connection problems are unique to the Microsoft bluetooth keyboards.,1
576,"I'm a big fan of the feel of the keyboard,",3
577,but I'd never risk getting another one of these because of the annoying connection problems.,1
578,I actually had better luck with the wireless,7
579,(non-bluetooth) version.,7
580,I purchased a Bluetooth dongle for my laptop,7
581,and was able to connect quickly and without a hitch via Windows 7 to this elegant but spare keyboard.,1
582,The keyboard works very well.,7
583,It is slim and lightweight with a curved ergonomic-type design,3
584,that Microsoft calls `` comfort curve ''.,7
585,"It's stylish too, with an all black keyboard, matte keys and rubberized rim.",5
586,One of the things,7
587,I noticed right off,7
588,is that,7
589,"despite the slender profile, it stays put on my desk, no slipping or sliding or rocking.",3
590,It's solid.,7
591,The key action is responsive,3
592,without being overly `` clicky '',6
593,and I am able to type rapidly and accurately.,7
594,"Time will tell about battery longevity,",7
595,which was a problem with a Bluetooth keyboard,7
596,I owned some years back.,7
597,"The AAA batteries were included in the box,",7
598,which is always appreciated.,7
599,"My only complaint about this product is that typically,",7
600,"when things work well,",7
601,there is no need for information or support.,7
602,If you are having difficulty,7
603,"coupling your equipment to this keyboard,",7
604,there is very little information,7
605,provided to help.,7
606,The keyboard works perfectly.,7
607,It connected easily to my Surface Pro tablet.,1
608,It sleeps,2
609,when not in use,2
610,so I expect the batteries to last for quite a while.,2
611,The layout is a bit unusual,4
612,and will take a little,4
613,getting used to.,4
614,It replaces a full size PC keyboard,7
615,I used on a desktop,7
616,which died.,7
617,It is more suited to my limited space,7
618,than the standard keyboard was.,7
619,Keys are smooth,3
620,and the ergonomic placement of keys is nice.,3
621,Getting a wireless keyboard will change the way,7
622,you interact with your tablet,7
623,"(or if you're ambitious, your mobile phone).",7
624,"The price for most of these seems to be around $ 60,",7
625,"which was too rich for me,",7
626,but the $ 30 this cost me was just about right.,8
627,"Yet,",7
628,"despite it being considerably cheaper than other keyboards,",8
629,the build,0
630,quality is solid.,0
631,I've lugged this around all over and have typed several 2000 word + blog posts on it easily.,7
632,Love the travel,7
633,and works well with my iPad.,7
634,Only gripe with it is it's not always clear,7
635,"when it's out of battery vs. just not connecting quite right,",1
636,but most of the time I keep it paired to the same device,1
637,and this isn't an issue.,7
638,I would purchase this keyboard in a heartbeat,7
639,if it weren't for one thing : the ridiculous layout of the navigation keys between the QWERTY and numeric keypad.,4
640,I really wish,7
641,manufacturers would stop,7
642,trying to re-invent the wheel with keyboard layouts.,7
643,I have been,7
644,using the same PC-AT layout for 25 years,7
645,I am not about to change.,7
646,Can they not recognise,7
647,that muscle memory exists with a vast majority of their customer base?,7
648,Rather than having a 3x2 grid they have messed everything up by converting it into a 2x3 grid.,7
649,Bad monkey.,7
650,No banana.,7
651,I really liked the keyboard.,7
652,It was a replacement to my apple keyboard,7
653,because I am forced to use a Windows rig for the next couple months.,7
654,I liked the feel of the keys,3
655,however the keyboard died for no reason after three weeks.,0
656,I guess,7
657,sometimes a penny saved,7
658,is a pound foolish.,7
659,Bad buy.,7
660,However Amazon allowed me to return,7
661,even though I've had it for a month.,7
662,I love Amazon!,7
663,I've had this for at least a year,7
664,and have used it as a second keyboard,7
665,when I'm out of town.,7
666,"I am used to the apple numerical chiclet keyboard,",7
667,and so I always fumble the keys with this one,7
668,because the windows key is not the same as the option/apple key etc..,4
669,Keyboard copy/paste keys are different too between the apple and this one.,4
670,So switching back and fourth takes some getting used to.,7
671,"The key profile on this keyboard is low, much better than the traditional keyboard full depth keys, but not as low as the apple,",3
672,and the typing doesn't have the satisfying punchy clickyness,3
673,that I really like with the apple keyboard.,7
674,It also doesn't have the USB connection in the keyboard.,1
675,"However, the winner-take-all here is the price.",8
676,"For the apple keyboard you pay a lot of money, for this,",7
677,it's very cheap.,8
678,"So if you have a tight budget,",7
679,and if you don't plan to switch back and fourth,7
680,"but would get used to this keyboard and the copy/paste/windows button,",7
681,then it will work fine with a mac,7
682,and be a good keyboard.,7
683,"I recently switched from a mac with a low profile stainless steel keyboard to a great new PC,",7
684,"except the keyboard was one of those high keyed, clackety-clunkety types.",7
685,Hated it.,7
686,"This keyboard,",7
687,"while not as low profile as the mac board,",7
688,is great.,7
689,"Solid feel, quick response, and quiet.",3
690,Purchase with confidence.,7
691,This keyboard does everything,7
692,a keyboard should.,7
693,"It is comfortable to use,",3
694,"it is quiet,",6
695,and it is very reliable.,0
696,"Also, at such a good price it is hard to beat!",8
697,I definitely recommend it.,7

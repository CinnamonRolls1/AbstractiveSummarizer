0,If you 're,7
1,"thinking of getting a new keyboard,",7
2,spend a few extra dollars,7
3,and get one,7
4,that's actually worth using.,7
5,"The layout is tricky, with the enter key bigger than any other key",4
6,(does anyone have trouble,7
7,hitting the enter key?),7
8,and the backspace key is a tiny little thing,4
9,that I can never hit the first time,4
10,without first hitting the \ a million times.,4
11,"The insert/home/delete / end cluster is squished into the print screen/scroll lock/pause keys,",4
12,which makes quick navigation difficult,3
13,without looking at the keys.,3
14,The rest of the keys are functional,7
15,but feel very flimsy.,3
16,"I haven't had a problem with `` squeaky '' keys,",6
17,but am very frustrated by the backspace,4
18,being so small and hard to reach.,4
19,"If you're a fan of shortcut buttons,",2
20,"there are the wake up, sleep, and power buttons, but no others for volume, internet, etc..",2
21,If you 're,7
22,"looking for a cheap, basic model",8
23,and don't care about retraining yourself to type then,7
24,this one's for you.,7
25,"Otherwise, spend a few extra dollars",7
26,and get a keyboard,7
27,that doesn't feel,3
28,like you bought it from the dollar shop.,3
29,The keys on the one,3
30,I received do not have a consistent feel across the keyboard.,3
31,Several don't respond to the same level of pressure as the other keys.,3
32,This makes the keyboard useless for someone,7
33,who really types fast.,7
34,"This keyboard also mushy, in the sense",3
35,that your keystrokes decelerate more quickly at the end of the stroke into a mush rather than a solid tap.,3
36,"In contrast, good keyboards for fast typing give increasing resistance up to a point and then less resistance down to solid contact at the bottom.",7
37,You get a feel,7
38,for where that resistance breaks,7
39,"(and the letter types),",7
40,and you can type,7
41,without hitting the bottom hard on most strokes.,7
42,"On a mushy keyboard like this one, you're never sure",3
43,"if your keystroke has registered,",3
44,so,7
45,after typing several sentences,7
46,"missing half the letters,",7
47,you hit the keys harder to compensate.,7
48,The spillproof design is interesting though.,2
49,Not sure,7
50,why more keyboards don't feature this.,7
51,"Pros : Not very expensive, supposedly spill proof, good 104 key layout.",8
52,Usable with both USB and PS2 ports.,1
53,Decent appearance.,5
54,Cons :,7
55,Usual mushy feel of a `` chicklet '',3
56,(membrane) keyboard.,3
57,I keep hoping against hope,7
58,that I'll find a decent office keyboard with a good `` feel ' at a moderate price.,7
59,This is not that keyboard.,7
60,I guess,7
61,I'll have to give up and just resign myself to much more expensive mechanical key units.,7
62,"However, they start at $ 50 or higher, not a trivial additional amount.",7
63,Top notch units are $ 100 or more.,7
64,Ouch!,7
65,But for anyone,7
66,"who uses a keyboard a lot, well worth the money.",7
67,I have had this keyboard for a few years now,7
68,and it has functioned,7
69,without a glitch.,7
70,"I type on it hours a day,",3
71,and the keys never stick or are hard to press.,3
72,"I took a star away, though,",7
73,because it does make about as much noise,6
74,as you could imagine,6
75,a keyboard would make.,6
76,I've owned keyboards in the past,7
77,that were whisper quiet,7
78,which was nice,7
79,because the rest of the office didn't have to know,7
80,whether you were typing or not.,7
81,They will know with this one.,6
82,But,7
83,"after going through numerous more expensive keyboards,",7
84,I have been happy as a lark,7
85,that this very inexpensive one has been going for years,8
86,without any issues.,7
87,"I just got this keyboard,",7
88,and I already love it.,7
89,It has the same,3
90,satisfying ` clickiness ' of the original IBM PC keyboard.,3
91,The only negative is the size of the backspace key,4
92,--,7
93,it's not oversize,4
94,as it is on many newer keyboards.,4
95,"But that's not a problem for me,",7
96,as I am used to a smaller backspace.,7
97,"This keyboard has the ` Wake Up ', ` Sleep ', and ` Power ' keys",2
98,that most Vista-capable computers support.,2
99,I particularly like being able to shut the system down with a keypress,2
100,--,7
101,I haven't been able to do that since my Mac days back in the late '80s!,7
102,"I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this keyboard, particularly for someone",7
103,"who wants the essentials,",7
104,without all the ` media keys ',7
105,and other junk,7
106,that seem to be found on most keyboards today.,7
107,The thing was for a serial port,1
108,not a USB port and new computers don't have serial ports.,1
109,A bust.,7
110,I have an old computer upstairs,7
111,which I'll hook it up to so it won't be a total waste.,7
112,I think,7
113,it was just the keyboard,7
114,"that I received,",7
115,but my spacebar would get stuck all the time.,0
116,"If I pressed the spacebar,",0
117,the computer would register multiple spaces.,0
118,"I am pretty sure this is not a software/driver issue,",7
119,I even downloaded the microsoft drivers,7
120,"and tried different keyboards,",7
121,it only happens with this one.,7
122,"And overall, the construction and materials used",0
123,is much inferior to the logitech,0
124,that I'm using now.,7
125,I used to be a fan of microsoft mice in the past,7
126,and thought,7
127,"I'd give this a try,",7
128,I don't think,7
129,I will be buying another Microsoft peripheral again.,7
130,Pros :,7
131,Good typing feel.,3
132,"Nice pre-programmed buttons for volume, calculator, and MyComputer.",2
133,Cons :,7
134,Cheap build : the little legs in the back,0
135,for tilting the keyboard break off right away.,0
136,"The home, end, insert, etc. keys are awkwardly placed.",4
137,Definitely not worth more than about $ 10!,8
138,But,7
139,"if you don't tilt your keyboard,",7
140,you might not think,7
141,it's bad at all.,7
142,"Unlike many people, I just want a standard keyboard with good touch and a PS2",7
143,(not USB) plug.,7
144,"Although this model has some custom keys for email, brower activation, music, etc,",2
145,I didn't bother with them.,7
146,The keys are a standard layout except for the Home/End cluster,4
147,which is vertical instead of horizontal.,4
148,That places the Insert key,4
149,"where the Delete key usually is,",4
150,but it hasn't been much of a problem.,7
151,"For the price,",8
152,I think,7
153,"this is a good buy,",8
154,and much better than other $ 15 keyboards.,8
155,I bought this as a simple back up for my wireless keyboard.,7
156,When the batteries go out I planned to use this one.,7
157,I ended up,7
158,using this one nearly exclusively!,7
159,"Yep its cheap and dinky,",8
160,"but it does the job well,",7
161,"feels good, has nice extra features,",3
162,and is CHEAP!,8
163,I purchased this for a new Mac Mini.,7
164,"I do not like the key action, the key noise and the cheap feel of the keyboard.",3
165,I shall return it to Amazon.,7
166,Pros : works,7
167,as it should right out of the box.,7
168,Special feature keys,2
169,"(volume control, mute, disk eject, power-off)",2
170,are handy.,2
171,"Cons : noisy keys,",6
172,"keyboard feels cheap,",3
173,key travel is shallow,3
174,and lacks,3
175,the quality feel,3
176,and quiet of every other Mac and Windows keyboard I use at home and work.,6
177,Verdict : Try any keyboard,7
178,before you purchase.,7
179,"If you dislike a cheap feel, noisy keys or a shallow mechanical key action,",3
180,you will be dissatisfied with this keyboard.,3
181,I can not stand this keyboard.,7
182,"I was forced to use one for a while,",7
183,and I decided to purchase a standard aluminum Apple keyboard with number pad,7
184,to save my sanity.,7
185,This Mac Ally keyboard is very loud and also cumbersome.,6
186,"However, it does hold pencils and pens quite well!",2
187,I'm confident,7
188,that,7
189,"if I were to pound on my desk,",7
190,the pencils would remain in the handy pencil/pen recess.,2
191,I gave 2 stars,7
192,"because the keyboard does work,",7
193,it's just not comfortable or quiet.,3
194,This was the cheapest keyboard,8
195,"I could find,",7
196,"and it does work, its just really loud!",6
197,It sounds almost,6
198,like you're typing on a typewriter.,6
199,I was too lazy to return it.,7
200,"This keyboard is indeed noisy,",6
201,but you know what?,6
202,I like that.,6
203,I also like not having to replace batteries every week.,7
204,"The number pad on the right side of the keyboard is a clutch feature, too.",2
205,"If you are a conventional home-row typer,",7
206,this keyboard will feel much more natural than the stock Mac keyboard.,3
207,"It is used by the three kids and me,",7
208,and we all agree,7
209,"that we prefer it,",7
210,and we rarely agree on anything.,7
211,I kept buying original iMac keyboards,7
212,and they kept breaking on me.,7
213,This one does not look like the original,5
214,but has all the keys like the original,4
215,except for the multimedia keys are not labeled but do work.,2
216,This one feels more like a PC keyboard,3
217,and it is wider,4
218,but it does last longer.,0
219,It is slim but not as slim as the iMac more like a slim PC keyboard.,5
220,Looks cheap but its not.,5
221,For the price i would buy this one any day.,8
222,Does not look as good as the original but last longer,5
223,and feels good to type in.,3
224,"When this keyboard worked,",7
225,it was everything,7
226,I had hoped for and more.,7
227,"The keys had the perfect amount of tension,",3
228,"the spacing was impeccable,",3
229,and the wrist rest was comfortable and stylish.,3
230,"Also, the wireless connectivity was good for my small room.",1
231,But about 6 months in of light use,0
232,"(never left my desk),",0
233,the S and A keys slowly started to malfunction.,0
234,"For a keyboard this price, it is ridiculous.",8
235,I've switched back to a cheap $ 10 dell keyboard,7
236,that can be dropped and stepped on with no ill effects.,7
237,"If you want to repurchase a keyboard every 6 months to a year,",0
238,then this is the keyboard for you.,7
239,"For everyone else, stay away!",7
240,I've had this keyboard for over a year with minor use.,7
241,The only issues,7
242,I had :,7
243,1.),7
244,The reception was sometimes spotty in registering clicks.,1
245,The receptor was at ye level in the back of my desktop standing 5 feet away.,7
246,2.),7
247,The spacebar rarely was recognized,3
248,when typing from the * SIDE * of the spacebar.,3
249,Tremendous mistake by Logitech designers.,7
250,3.),7
251,"After a year of limited use, certain keys on the upper left had corner of the KB",0
252,just suddenly stopped working.,0
253,"On a positive note, Logitech Customer Service took care of my defective KB under the warranty plan",7
254,when the keys stopped working.,0
255,"Logitech makes the best keyboards and mice, hands down.",7
256,"I ordered this in 2009 along with an HP keyboard to compare,",7
257,but there was no comparison.,7
258,"The Logitech keyboard Had a much better build quality,",0
259,"look and feel,",3
260,and those signature buttery smooth keys.,3
261,Typing on this keyboard is like velvet or down feathers or something so silky smooth.,3
262,"But, a big but, in the end this keyboard has serious flaws.",7
263,"It lags and is unresponsive at times,",7
264,it disconnects from the USB dongle,1
265,"and needs to be re-setup,",1
266,And worst of all the power switch is very flimsy and no longer connects.,0
267,I have to jiggle and wiggle it into exactly the right position,0
268,to stay on.,0
269,Expected more from Logitech's top dollar keyboards.,8
270,"Well, it came out 10 + years ago so not too unexpected.",7
271,"Ive decided to chuck it and go with a much newer, cheaper, lighter version, the K360.",7
272,"Only 24 bills,",7
273,and connects with my Logitech mouse to the Unifying receiver...,7
274,This has been a great little wireless keyboard.,7
275,It's small,7
276,and I keep it on my bedside table,7
277,to use with my media pc.,7
278,I've had it for over 6 months,7
279,and it's still on the first set of batteries.,7
280,The buttons have great feel like most logitech stuff.,3
281,The keypad feels like a good laptop keyboard.,3
282,If it had a touch pad,7
283,it'd be the bomb.,7
284,It would also be nice,7
285,if the keys did illuminate.,2
286,"It does feel like a quality piece in your hands, not some super cheap wireless keyboard.",0
287,I caught it on sale for around $ 25.,8
288,"What can I say, its about time, perfect keyboard.",7
289,"Keys are light and easy to use,",3
290,"layout is perfect,",4
291,programmable function keys are great.,2
292,Just wish,7
293,I wouldn't have waited so long,7
294,to purchase!,7
295,"If your looking for a wireless keyboard, desktop or laptop,",7
296,this is your keyboard...,7
297,you will not be disappointed!!,7
298,I've had this keyboard for about six months,0
299,and the letters are wearing off of the keys.,0
300,I've had many keyboards over the years,7
301,and none have done this even after several years of heavy use.,7
302,The letters should be molded into the plastic.,0
303,Instead they 're,0
304,applied to the key surfaces afterwords.,0
305,"The volume control keys are on the right side,",4
306,and they 're,7
307,activated by a function key,4
308,that is also only on the right side.,4
309,That means changing,4
310,the volume,4
311,(or muting),7
312,requires the movement of both hands.,4
313,It's a poor design for such frequently-used keys.,4
314,The arrow keys are a bit too small for such often-used keys.,4
315,"I bought the HP wireless keyboard,",7
316,and it has none of these problems.,7
317,"It is larger however,",7
318,and it has short-stroke keys like a laptop.,7
319,Some may prefer the more standard keystroke,7
320,that the Logitech offers.,7
321,"All-in-all, I like the cheaper HP much better.",7
322,Keyboard works great.,7
323,"However, I accidentally broke the wireless usb receiver.",7
324,Called logitech for a replacement,7
325,and they said,7
326,it would be a 3 month wait.,7
327,This pretty much renders my purchase useless.,7
328,Its surprising,7
329,"that a company would fail to stock such a critical, small, and easily replaceable item.",7
330,Do your self a favor a purchase from another company,7
331,I had to purchase 2 other keyboards,7
332,before I found this one.,7
333,I say,7
334,it is OK,7
335,because it is not quite as comfortable as the one,3
336,I was used to.,3
337,The space bar is long enough but not wide enough.,4
338,Sometimes I have to strike the space bar more than once,4
339,because it doesn't stand quite high enough,4
340,to work with my right thumb.,4
341,Overall I think,7
342,it could be a little longer,4
343,because the keys seem to be crowded.,4
344,Bought this wireless keyboard for our HTPC.,7
345,It is fairly light keyboard,3
346,and is about the size of a full size keyboard on a laptop.,5
347,"The keys feel as good as non-wireless Logitech keyboards,",3
348,so I have no complaints there.,3
349,"Also, there is no noticeable lag from the time",7
350,you press a key,7
351,and it registering on the screen.,7
352,We have had this keyboard for a month now,7
353,and have not had to change the batteries.,7
354,"I have not verified the range for this keyboard,",1
355,but we keep it around 10 feet from the computer.,1
356,I only have a couple of minor complaints about the keyboard.,7
357,"First, I wish",7
358,it had a light,7
359,to indicate,7
360,whether the NumLock is on or off.,7
361,"Secondly, about 1 in 10 times",1
362,when I initially use the keyboard I have to log out and log back in,1
363,to get the keyboard to work.,1
364,I suspect,1
365,"this may be do to the location of the RF receiver for the keyboard,",1
366,which is at the back of the HTPC.,1
367,I like these so much,7
368,I ordered another for work,7
369,to use with my laptop.,7
370,"Unfortunately, it appears",7
371,Logitech is discontinuing this particular model.,7
372,"The replacement appears to use "" island "" keys",7
373,which I dislike.,7
374,I like this model enough,7
375,that I'll probably buy a couple more refurbished units online just to keep around as spares.,7
376,Keyboards are largely a personal preference.,7
377,"For me, this keyboard has the perfect size, height, tactile feel and sound, and the perfect key resistance.",3
378,I type faster and with fewer errors on this keyboard,3
379,than any I've ever used before.,7
380,Wireless and the batteries last a good long while.,1
381,Love it!,7
382,I bought this keyboard in hopes,8
383,that the price would reflect some kind of quality.,8
384,I was severely disappointed.,8
385,The top row of number keys all stuck right out of the box.,0
386,"The Num-lock, 7,4,1, and zero keys stopped working after 1 hour,",0
387,"and the down arrow quit too, then the spacebar.",0
388,Totally frustrated.,7
389,I wont be replacing this one with another.,7
390,I'll buy a different brand.,7
391,Steer clear!,7
392,"This keyboard is nice,",7
393,the response is good,3
394,and the keys light up and are quite legible in darkness or low light.,2
395,It does not have convensional format for spacing of keys.,4
396,Anytime you use a non letter key,4
397,you'll have to make use of it's visibility,4
398,to see,4
399,where the key is on the board.,4
400,The keyboard looks nice,5
401,but it has a few flaws.,7
402,"There's no mute button,",2
403,some of the keys are to small.,3
404,If you have a desktop,7
405,"that you use in a darkened room,",7
406,you will like this keyboard,7
407,"This keyboard is awesome,",7
408,the light is bright,2
409,and makes it easy to use in dim light or dark.,2
410,The only problem is,7
411,that the keys are so close together,4
412,and it is not set up like most keyboards.,4
413,"The delete, home, end, page up and down,",4
414,and arrow keys are all small and squished in with the rest of the keyboard keys.,4
415,But it was easy to hook up,1
416,and works great!,1
417,"Looked all over the place for this type of LED key bourd,",7
418,"had this almost two years now,",7
419,"for this price and the blue letters work very good in low light,",8
420,it's a lttle small,5
421,and fits well on top of your desk.,7
422,A full size keyboard should not cause even the biggest guy,7
423,to feel ` fat fingered '.,7
424,Also the location of some of the important keys,4
425,(like backspace and delete),4
426,are in odd places.,4
427,Even the space bar is tiny.,4
428,I definitely would not recommend this for gaming or a lot of typing.,7
429,I like the backlight though.,2
430,Dad wanted a keyboard,7
431,he could see at night,7
432,without his lights on in the house other than a little desk lamp.,7
433,They keys are TOO close together more so than any keyboard,4
434,any of my family has used.,7
435,This didn't work,7
436,so we pitched,7
437,it and he went back to his old keyboard,7
438,without a light.,7
439,I surely wouldn't recommend this piece of work to anyone.,7
440,I mean what good is a keyboard,7
441,if some of the keys don't work?????,7
442,None of the lighted keyboards I checked out,7
443,when I bought,7
444,this had very good reviews,7
445,but for Dad I bought one anyway.,7
446,What a waste of time and money.,8
447,May God bless.,7
448,This is a pretty good keyboard for the price.,8
449,The backlit keys look great,2
450,and there aren't any issues,7
451,to speak of.,7
452,But,7
453,"if you want a full sized keyboard,",4
454,this isn't what you 're,4
455,looking for.,4
456,Not sure,7
457,why it's listed as full sized,7
458,as I think anyone,7
459,looking for a quality compact keyboard would be thrilled with this item.,7
460,"Otherwise, a solid device.",7
461,"This keyboard is nice and bright, plug and play and easy to use.",1
462,The price is also right.,8
463,If you're a gamer like me,7
464,"and just need a little light for your keys to find your bearings sometime,",2
465,this will work for you.,7
466,I had to take a star off,7
467,because they made the keyboard compact,4
468,and cut the size of the back/delete key.,4
469,This is really annoying for non gaming or word,7
470,processing,7
471,as you will miss the key often,7
472,if you 're,7
473,used to a standard keyboard.,7
474,I purchased this keyboard,7
475,because I like to surf the web right before go to sleep,7
476,and usually the lights are off.,7
477,Even though I can type,7
478,without looking at the keyboard...,7
479,it was still a little hard to type with the lights off.,7
480,So I looked up some backlit keyboards,7
481,and saw,7
482,that this one had some good reviews.,7
483,I like the blue LED color.,2
484,"It's bright enough to see,",2
485,but not too bright in the dark.,2
486,You can also turn the lights on and off.,2
487,"They keyboard has a great feel,",3
488,but I have one complaint.,7
489,They say,7
490,"it's a full size keyboard,",7
491,but it feels a little smaller than a full size.,4
492,It feels,3
493,like the size is between a full size keyboard and a laptop computer.,3
494,I guess,7
495,I just wish,4
496,the backspace button was a little larger...,4
497,I'm always,7
498,missing it!,7
499,Haha.,7
500,But for the price you are getting a great product,8
501,and I would recommend it to anyone,7
502,looking for a backlit keyboard.,7
503,Have tried to work with this for a couple of months with my iMac Intel.,7
504,It is never discoverable by the computer,1
505,and,7
506,when it can be used,1
507,it takes some time for it to wake up,1
508,and provide service.,1
509,The help from the manufacturer is very poor,7
510,and I'm disgusted with them and this nasty piece of work.,7
511,I got this keyboard,8
512,when it was discounted to $ 8.95.,8
513,And it's probably only worth that much.,8
514,It frequently looses the bluetooth connection with my MacBook Pro,1
515,"and drops the key presses, especially with the space bar.",0
516,So I keep on editing what type.,7
517,"Also key are a bit harder to press,",3
518,"and the contact connections may not always work,",0
519,resulting in skipped characters on the screen.,0
520,There are better keyboards for the price.,8
521,I bought this as a replacement for a PC keyboard I was using,7
522,that was way too loud.,7
523,This one,1
524,connected fine,1
525,and works well enough.,7
526,It's small and attractive.,5
527,My only complaint is,7
528,that the keys are loose,0
529,-,7
530,they kind of wobble,0
531,"where they sit,",0
532,"which gives it a cheapish feel,",3
533,makes the fingers a bit unsure,3
534,of where to sit,3
535,and makes using the keyboard louder,6
536,than it needs to be.,6
537,This keyboard worked,7
538,as promised.,7
539,It easily connects to my iPad and Droidx.,1
540,The price is right.,8
541,My only complaint is the lack of a proper on/off switch.,2
542,I travel a lot,7
543,and unless I remove the batteries,7
544,it comes on in my suitcase,7
545,and I end up with dead batteries.,7
546,"I work on my phone,",7
547,"so this is wonderful, i had checked apple",7
548,"and almost spent twice the price, of course this one is plastic",8
549,but it works just great none the less. i have had mine over a year,0
550,"and it still is working great,",0
551,only drawback is the on and off button is so tiny,2
552,"that it is hard to slide,",2
553,but hey use,7
554,a pen and dont complain.,7
555,I was excited about using this keyboard,7
556,for when I was traveling and using my tablet.,7
557,I liked ergonomics and the lightness,3
558,and all was well...,7
559,until the 3d time I tried to use it.,7
560,Dead.,0
561,"Changed batteries,",0
562,made no difference.,0
563,It had not been banged around,0
564,and no reason for this to happen.,0
565,Can't recommend this item!,7
566,This keyboard is very hard to type on and will cause your wrists to ache.,3
567,It lays flat,3
568,rather than have some level of angle.,3
569,"Also, the bluetooth connection turns off after a certain amount of inactivity,",1
570,which caused intermittent delays,1
571,while I was writing.,1
572,"For example, I'd type a paragraph,",7
573,go back,7
574,"and read it,",7
575,"maybe think for a minute,",7
576,"and when I went back to type again I would get a delayed reaction, sometimes for 10 or more seconds",1
577,until the connection would re-establish.,1
578,This was even more annoying,7
579,when surfing the web.,7
580,Sometimes I wouldn't be able to use my keyboard to type in my password,1
581,"to log in to the computer, very annoying.",1
582,"I liked the idea of not having to have a USB wireless receiver for my keyboard and mouse,",7
583,but the reality is,7
584,that this solution is too uncomfortable and unreliable.,1
585,I would not recommend this product.,7
586,This is probably the most comfortable keyboard,3
587,I've ever used.,3
588,"The slight curvature in the middle of the keyboard makes for a more relaxed typing position,",3
589,"without being too exaggerated like the "" split "" keyboards",3
590,that have a gap,7
591,running top-to-bottom through the keyboard with an upward angle,7
592,that strains my wrists.,7
593,"The slim depth of this keyboard helps keep my wrists relaxed, as well.",3
594,The big issue with this keyboard is,1
595,that it loses the bluetooth connection with my laptop on a regular basis.,1
596,I have to uninstall/reinstall the keyboard sometimes as often as a few times per month.,7
597,"I don't have any problems with other bluetooth devices,",7
598,so I assume,7
599,it is something with the keyboard.,7
600,I don't know,7
601,if it is the actual keyboard or the software,1
602,(drivers).,7
603,"If this keyboard wasn't so comfortable to type on,",3
604,I would have sent it back.,7
605,A beautiful keyboard,5
606,which if you get it for a deal,8
607,is well worth it.,7
608,I take it with me on vacation,7
609,to use with my bluetooth tablet or phone.,7
610,One could put a bluetooth adapter in a netbook,7
611,and get a much more comfortable keyboard.,3
612,I have not ever liked the Microsoft keyboards,7
613,which were contoured,7
614,and had a break in the middle between the G and the H.,7
615,I learned typing in high school,7
616,and those keyboards slow me down.,7
617,This one fits the way,3
618,your fingers would naturally sit.,3
619,Each row is on a bit of a curve upward at the ends,4
620,just as all my Logitech keyboards have been.,7
621,I initially bought a cheap keyboard,7
622,(the Anker),7
623,and I received a defective unit.,7
624,After returning it I decided,7
625,that it was worth another $ 15 for a high quality product.,7
626,I absolutely do not regret it.,7
627,I've had zero problems,1
628,"with pairing and connecting this keyboard,",1
629,and the key feel is very good for such a thin keyboard.,3
630,The build,0
631,quality seems very good as well.,0
632,My only complaint is,2
633,"that some flip-out feet would be nice,",2
634,but those always seem to break anyway.,7
635,Pros :,7
636,It's cheap and a little quieter than a regular keyboard.,8
637,Cons :,7
638,It's not silent.,6
639,It died less than 5 months,0
640,after I bought it.,0
641,The Rosewill website helpfully says,7
642,"the warranty is "" Repair Only "".",7
643,"Unfortunately, the postage charges mean",7
644,it's not worth sending this back to Rosewill for repair.,7
645,"I would write more but really,",7
646,it's a keyboard,7
647,that's a little quieter than others.,6
648,"It hasn't changed my life, solved general relativity",7
649,or provided answers about the meaning of life.,7
650,It died,0
651,and isn't worth replacing.,7
652,Even Tolstoy couldn't do much with that.,7
653,About the only thing this keyboard has going for it is its price.,8
654,"I was looking for a thin, basic keyboard",7
655,that wouldn't make,7
656,me arch my wrists,7
657,when I type.,7
658,Keyboard seemed to occasionally miss button presses,3
659,and was just generally fairly inaccurate.,7
660,Replaced it with a slightly more expensive K120 from Logitech,7
661,"and find it to be much better,",7
662,even though it is a little thicker with more travel in the keys.,7
663,I also have a Logitech solar K750,7
664,that is even thinner than the Rosewell,7
665,"and I also much prefer its typing characteristics and accuracy,",7
666,though it is much more expensive and not in the same league.,7
667,That's all,6
668,you hear with this keyboard,6
669,- a loud ticking/clacking noise as you type.,6
670,"It works well,",7
671,but,7
672,"if you want something quiet,",6
673,this isn't it.,6
674,"It's also somewhat bulky,",3
675,but for the price,8
676,you get,8
677,what you pay for.,7
678,"It works, no bells or whistles.",7
679,It is my own fault,7
680,but the only thing,7
681,I wish for on this,7
682,"is some media buttons such as volume,",2
683,since I am using it in a set up with a macbook pro,7
684,and dont want to have to reach to my laptop,7
685,"to control the volume,",7
686,but that wasn't in the design.,7
687,It feels a bit cheap,0
688,but what do,8
689,you expect at the price.,8
690,In general functionality is good for a simple small chiclet keyboard.,7
691,"For $ 10, this isn't bad at all.",8
692,Very nice keyboard with very responsive keys.,3
693,"They're kinda loud,",6
694,but meh I don't care.,7
695,I spilt water on it a few days ago,0
696,and It's still working perfectly so,0
697,that's pretty awesome. 5 stars.,7
